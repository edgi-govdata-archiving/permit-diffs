Footnotes:
1. Grab samples for Outfall 001 shall be collected at the discharge point from the Facility’s OWS, prior to commingling with any other
wastestream. Samples shall be collected during the first qualifying event that occurs for each required measurement frequency, after

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Draft Permit
Page 8 of 30

treatment through the stormwater treatment system and free from tidal influence. A qualifying event shall be defined as a discharge
that occurs during daylight hours on an outgoing tide at least one hour from both the low and high slack tide. To identify a
qualifying event, the permittee may use tide charts to predict the two four-hour intervals of an outgoing tide each day that are one
hour from both low and high slack tide. If a measurable discharge does not occur such that sampling cannot be completed during the
first qualifying event of the required sampling frequency, the permittee is to sample the next qualifying event. The qualifying event
requirement does not apply to sampling for the measurement frequency “when discharging”. Samples shall be grab samples taken
within 15 minutes of the initiation of a discharge during a qualifying event where practicable, but in no case later than within the
first hour of discharge from the outfall. Changes in sampling location must be approved in writing by the Environmental Protection
Agency Region 1 (EPA). The Permittee shall report the results to EPA and the State of any additional testing above that required
herein, if testing is done in accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 136.
2. In accordance with 40 CFR § 122.44(i)(1)(iv), the Permittee shall monitor according to sufficiently sensitive test procedures (i.e.,
methods) approved under 40 CFR Part 136 or required under 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N or O, for the analysis of pollutants or
pollutant parameters (except WET). A method is “sufficiently sensitive” when: 1) the method minimum level (ML) is at or below
the level of the effluent limitation established in the permit for the measured pollutant or pollutant parameter; or 2) the method has
the lowest ML of the analytical methods approved under 40 CFR Part 136 or required under 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N or O
for the measured pollutant or pollutant parameter. The term “minimum level” refers to either the sample concentration equivalent to
the lowest calibration point in a method or a multiple of the method detection limit (MDL), whichever is higher. Minimum levels
may be obtained in several ways: They may be published in a method; they may be based on the lowest acceptable calibration point
used by a laboratory; or they may be calculated by multiplying the MDL in a method, or the MDL determined by a laboratory, by a
factor.
3. When a parameter is not detected above the ML, the Permittee must report the data qualifier signifying less than the ML for that
parameter (e.g., < 5 μg/L, if the ML for a parameter is 5 μg/L). For calculating and reporting the average monthly concentration
when one or more values are not detected, assign a value of zero to all non-detects and report the average of all the results. The
number of exceedances shall be enumerated for each parameter in the field provided on every Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR).
4. Measurement frequency of “when discharging” is defined as the sampling of any measurable discharge event, reported for each
calendar month. Sampling frequency of 1/month is defined as the sampling of one discharge event in each calendar month. Sampling
frequency of 1/quarter is defined as the sampling of one discharge event in each quarter. Calendar quarters are defined as January
through March, inclusive, April through June, inclusive, July through September, inclusive and October through December,
inclusive. Sampling frequency of 1/year is defined as the sampling of one discharge event during one calendar year, unless otherwise

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Draft Permit
Page 9 of 30

specified. If no sample is collected during the measurement frequencies defined above, the Permittee must report an appropriate No
Data Indicator Code.
5. For Flow Rate, the maximum daily value represents the maximum instantaneous flow rate measured by the Facility as passing
through the treatment system for each day that a discharge occurs during the reported period. The maximum instantaneous flow rate,
which is to be reported in units of gallons per minute (GPM), shall be an estimate based on the summation of the pump curve
value(s) for all pumps in operation which control the rate of flow through the OWS when discharge is occurring. The Permittee shall
at no time exceed the design flow rate of the treatment system.
6. For Total Flow, the value reported represents the sum of the recorded discharge volume for each day that effluent is discharged
during that month, measured at the treatment system using a totalizer or similar device. Total Flow shall be reported in the units of
millions of gallons per month (Mgal/Mo). The Permittee shall also report the total number of days during the reporting period
discharges from the outfall occurred (i.e., a measurable volume of effluent passes through the totalizer or similar device).
7. The pH shall be within the specified range at all times. The minimum and maximum pH sample measurement values for the month
shall be reported in standard units (S.U.).
8. Results must be reported in most probable number (MPN). After a minimum one year following the effective date of the permit and
12 samples, the sampling frequency for Enterococcus shall reduce to 1/year if all sample results are less than the applicable water
quality criteria.
9. Daily maximum temperature must be taken for the influent (i.e., boiler blowdown/steam condensate), the effluent, and the receiving
water at the time of collection and the results reported on the appropriate DMR. Temperature shall be measured using EPAapproved methods in 40 CFR §136 (e.g., Method 2550-B-2000).
10. The ML for analysis for benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and total xylenes shall be no greater than 2 µg/L.
11. The Permittee shall conduct annual monitoring of the effluent during the month of September for the following compounds:
benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene,
acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, fluoranthene, fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene,
toluene, ethylbenzene, and total xylenes. Sampling shall be performed concurrently with the monthly monitoring event. If no
discharge occurs during the month of September, the Permittee shall sample the next qualifying event.

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Draft Permit
Page 10 of 30

12. The ML for analysis for the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) shall be no greater than the following: 0.1 μg/L for
benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, indeno(1,2,3cd)pyrene and 5 μg/L for acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, fluoranthene, fluorene, naphthalene,
phenanthrene, pyrene. The ML for benzo(a)pyrene, 0.1 μg/L, shall represent the compliance level for that compound.
13. Monitoring for total residual chlorine (TRC) is only required for discharges that have been previously chlorinated or that contain
residual chlorine. For the purposes of this permit, TRC analysis must be completed using a test method in 40 CFR Part 136 that
achieves a minimum level of detection no greater than 30 μg/L. The compliance level for TRC is 30 μg/L.
14. Total Phthalates is the sum of: diethylhexyl phthalate (CAS No. 117-81-7); butyl benzyl phthalate (CAS No. 85-68-7); di-n-butyl
phthalate (CAS No. 84-74-2); diethyl phthalate (CAS No. 84-66-2); dimethyl phthalate (CAS No. 131-11-3); di-n-octyl phthalate
(CAS No. 117-84-0).
15. Free cyanide must be analyzed (i.e., not total cyanide). For the purposes of this permit, cyanide analysis must be completed using a
test method in 40 CFR Part 136 that achieves a minimum level of detection no greater than 2 μg/L. The compliance level for cyanide
is 2 μg/L.
16. This reporting requirement for the listed PFAS parameters takes effect six months after EPA’s multi-lab validated method for
wastewater is made available to the public on EPA’s CWA methods program website. See https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods/otherclean-water-act-test-methods-chemical and https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods .
17. After one year of monitoring, if all samples are non-detect for all six PFAS compounds, using EPA’s multi-lab validated method
for wastewater, the Permittee may request to remove the requirement for PFAS monitoring. See Special Condition in Part I.C.6.
18. The Permittee shall conduct acute toxicity tests (LC50) 1/ quarter in accordance with test procedures and protocol specified in
Attachment A of this permit. LC50 is defined in Part II.E. of this permit. The Permittee shall test the daphnid, Ceriodaphnia dubia,
and the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas. The complete report for each toxicity test shall be submitted as an attachment to the
monthly DMR submittal immediately following the completion of the test.
19. For Part I.A.1., Whole Effluent Toxicity Testing, the Permittee shall conduct the analyses specified in Attachment A, Part VI.
CHEMICAL ANALYSIS for the effluent sample. If toxicity test(s) using the receiving water as diluent show the receiving water to
be toxic or unreliable, the Permittee shall follow procedures outlined in Attachment A, Section IV., DILUTION WATER. Even

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Draft Permit
Page 11 of 30

where alternate dilution water has been used, the results of the receiving water control (0% effluent) analyses must be reported.
Minimum levels and test methods are specified in Attachment A, Part VI. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS.
20. For Part I.A.1., Ambient Characteristic, the Permittee shall conduct the analyses specified in Attachment A, Part VI. CHEMICAL
ANALYSIS for the receiving water sample collected as part of the WET testing requirements. Such samples shall be taken from the
receiving water at a point immediately upstream of the permitted discharge’s zone of influence at a reasonably accessible location,
as specified in Attachment A. Minimum levels and test methods are specified in Attachment A, Part VI. CHEMICAL
ANALYSIS.
21. A pH and temperature measurement shall be taken of each receiving water sample at the time of collection and the results reported
on the appropriate DMR. These pH and temperature measurements are independent from any pH and temperature measurements
required by the WET testing protocols.
22. The Permittee shall conduct annual monitoring of the receiving water during the month of April for the following compounds:
benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, indeno(1,2,3cd)pyrene, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, fluoranthene, fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene,
pyrene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and total xylenes. The ML for analysis shall be no greater than the following: 0.1 μg/L for
Group I PAHs, 5 μg/L for Group II PAHs, and 2 μg/L for benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and total xylenes. The receiving water

1. Grab samples for Outfall 002 shall be collected at the discharge point from the Facility’s treatment system, prior to commingling
with any other wastestream. Sampling may be conducted inside of the treatment system building at the outlet of the final treatment
component. Samples shall be collected during the first qualifying event that occurs for each required measurement frequency, after
treatment through the groundwater treatment system. If a measurable discharge does not occur such that sampling cannot be
completed during the first qualifying event of the required sampling frequency, the permittee is to sample the next qualifying event.
The qualifying event requirement does not apply to sampling for the measurement frequency “when discharging”. Samples shall be
grab samples taken within 15 minutes of the initiation of a discharge during a qualifying event where practicable, but in no case later
than within the first hour of discharge from the outfall. Changes in sampling location must be approved in writing by the
Environmental Protection Agency Region 1 (EPA). The Permittee shall report the results to EPA and the State of any additional
testing above that required herein, if testing is done in accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 136.

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Draft Permit
Page 13 of 30

2. In accordance with 40 CFR § 122.44(i)(1)(iv), the Permittee shall monitor according to sufficiently sensitive test procedures (i.e.,
methods) approved under 40 CFR Part 136 or required under 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N or O, for the analysis of pollutants or
pollutant parameters (except WET). A method is “sufficiently sensitive” when: 1) the method minimum level (ML) is at or below
the level of the effluent limitation established in the permit for the measured pollutant or pollutant parameter; or 2) the method has
the lowest ML of the analytical methods approved under 40 CFR Part 136 or required under 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N or O
for the measured pollutant or pollutant parameter. The term “minimum level” refers to either the sample concentration equivalent to
the lowest calibration point in a method or a multiple of the method detection limit (MDL), whichever is higher. Minimum levels
may be obtained in several ways: They may be published in a method; they may be based on the lowest acceptable calibration point
used by a laboratory; or they may be calculated by multiplying the MDL in a method, or the MDL determined by a laboratory, by a
factor.
3. When a parameter is not detected above the ML, the Permittee must report the data qualifier signifying less than the ML for that
parameter (e.g., < 5 μg/L, if the ML for a parameter is 5 μg/L). For calculating and reporting the average monthly concentration
when one or more values are not detected, assign a value of zero to all non-detects and report the average of all the results. The
number of exceedances shall be enumerated for each parameter in the field provided on every Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR).
4. Measurement frequency of “when discharging” is defined as the sampling of any measurable discharge event, reported for each
calendar month. Sampling frequency of 1/month is defined as the sampling of one discharge event in each calendar month. Sampling
frequency of 1/quarter is defined as the sampling of one discharge event in each quarter. Calendar quarters are defined as January
through March, inclusive, April through June, inclusive, July through September, inclusive and October through December,
inclusive. Sampling frequency of 1/year is defined as the sampling of one discharge event during one calendar year, unless otherwise
specified. If no sample is collected during the measurement frequencies defined above, the Permittee must report an appropriate No
Data Indicator Code.
5. For Flow Rate, the maximum daily value represents the maximum instantaneous flow rate measured by the Facility as passing
through the treatment system for each day that a discharge occurs during the reported period. The maximum instantaneous flow rate,
which is to be reported in units of gallons per minute (GPM), shall be an estimate based on the summation of the pump curve
value(s) for all pumps in operation which control the rate of flow through the OWS when discharge is occurring. The Permittee shall
at no time exceed the design flow rate of the treatment system.
6. For Total Flow, the value reported represents the sum of the recorded discharge volume for each day that effluent is discharged
during that month, measured at the treatment system using a totalizer or similar device. Total Flow shall be reported in the units of

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Draft Permit
Page 14 of 30

millions of gallons per month (Mgal/Mo). The Permittee shall also report the total number of days during the reporting period
discharges from the outfall occurred (i.e., a measurable volume of effluent passes through the totalizer or similar device).
7. The pH shall be within the specified range at all times. The minimum and maximum pH sample measurement values for the month
shall be reported in standard units (S.U.).

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Draft Permit

Part I.A. continued.
2. The discharge shall not cause a violation of the water quality standards of the receiving water.
3. The discharge shall be free from pollutants in concentrations or combinations that, in the
receiving water, settle to form objectionable deposits; float as debris, scum or other matter to
form nuisances; produce objectionable odor, color, taste or turbidity; or produce undesirable or
nuisance species of aquatic life.
4. The discharge shall be free from pollutants in concentrations or combinations that adversely
affect the physical, chemical, or biological nature of the bottom.
5. The discharge shall not result in pollutants in concentrations or combinations in the receiving
water that are toxic to humans, aquatic life or wildlife.
6. The discharge shall be free from floating, suspended and settleable solids in concentrations or
combinations that would impair any use assigned to the receiving water.
7. The discharge shall be free from oil, grease and petrochemicals that produce a visible film on
the surface of the water, impart an oily taste to the water or an oily or other undesirable taste to
the edible portions of aquatic life, coat the banks or bottom of the water course, or are
deleterious or become toxic to aquatic life.
8. All existing manufacturing, commercial, mining, and silvicultural dischargers must notify the
Director as soon as they know or have reason to believe (40 CFR § 122.42):
a. That any activity has occurred or will occur which would result in the discharge, on a
routine or frequent basis, of any toxic pollutant which is not limited in the permit, if that

MARINE ACUTE
TOXICITY TEST PROCEDURE AND PROTOCOL

I. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
The permittee shall conduct acceptable acute toxicity tests in accordance with the appropriate
test protocols described below:
•

2007.0 - Mysid Shrimp (Americamysis bahia) definitive 48 hour test.

•

2006.0 - Inland Silverside (Menidia beryllina) definitive 48 hour test.

Acute toxicity data shall be reported as outlined in Section VIII.
II. METHODS
The permittee shall use the most recent 40 CFR Part 136 methods. Whole Effluent Toxicity
(WET) Test Methods and guidance may be found at:
http://water.epa.gov/scitech/methods/cwa/wet/index.cfm#methods
The permittee shall also meet the sampling, analysis and reporting requirements included in this
protocol. This protocol defines more specific requirements while still being consistent with the
Part 136 methods. If, due to modifications of Part 136, there are conflicting requirements
between the Part 136 method and this protocol, the permittee shall comply with the requirements
of the Part 136 method.
III. SAMPLE COLLECTION
A discharge and receiving water sample shall be collected. The receiving water control sample
must be collected immediately upstream of the permitted discharge’s zone of influence. The
acceptable holding times until initial use of a sample are 24 and 36 hours for on-site and off-site
testing, respectively. A written waiver is required from the regulating authority for any holding
time extension. Sampling guidance dictates that, where appropriate, aliquots for the analysis
required in this protocol shall be split from the samples, containerized and immediately
preserved, or analyzed as per 40 CFR Part 136. EPA approved test methods require that samples
collected for metals analyses be preserved immediately after collection. Testing for the presence
of total residual chlorine 1 (TRC) must be analyzed immediately or as soon as possible, for all
effluent samples, prior to WET testing. TRC analysis may be performed on-site or by the toxicity
testing laboratory and the samples must be dechlorinated, as necessary, using sodium thiosulfate
1

For this protocol, total residual chlorine is synonymous with total residual oxidants.

(July 2012)

Page 1 of 10

prior to sample use for toxicity testing. If performed on site the results should be included on the
chain of custody (COC) presented to WET laboratory.
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater describes dechlorination of
samples (APHA, 1992). Dechlorination can be achieved using a ratio of 6.7 mg/L anhydrous
sodium thiosulfate to reduce 1 mg/L chlorine. If dechlorination is necessary, a thiosulfate control
consisting of the maximum concentration of thiosulfate used to dechlorinate the sample in the
toxicity test control water must also be run in the WET test.
All samples submitted for chemical and physical analyses will be analyzed according to Section
VI of this protocol. Grab samples must be used for pH, temperature, and total residual chlorine
(as per 40 CFR Part 122.21).
All samples held for use beyond the day of sampling shall be refrigerated and maintained at a
temperature range of 0-6o C.
IV. DILUTION WATER
Samples of receiving water must be collected from a reasonably accessible location in the
receiving water body immediately upstream of the permitted discharge’s zone of influence.
Avoid collection near areas of obvious road or agricultural runoff, storm sewers or other point
source discharges and areas where stagnant conditions exist. EPA strongly urges that screening
for toxicity be performed prior to the set up of a full, definitive toxicity test any time there is a
question about the test dilution water's ability to achieve test acceptability criteria (TAC) as
indicated in Section V of this protocol. The test dilution water control response will be used in
the statistical analysis of the toxicity test data. All other control(s) required to be run in the test
will be reported as specified in the Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) Instructions,
Attachment F, page 2,Test Results & Permit Limits.
The test dilution water must be used to determine whether the test met the applicable TAC.
When receiving water is used for test dilution, an additional control made up of standard
laboratory water (0% effluent) is required. This control will be used to verify the health of the
test organisms and evaluate to what extent, if any, the receiving water itself is responsible for any
toxic response observed.
If dechlorination of a sample by the toxicity testing laboratory is necessary a “sodium
thiosulfate” control, representing the concentration of sodium thiosulfate used to adequately
dechlorinate the sample prior to toxicity testing, must be included in the test.
If the use of alternate dilution water (ADW) is authorized, in addition to the ADW test control,
the testing laboratory must, for the purpose of monitoring the receiving water, also run a
receiving water control.
If the receiving water is found to be, or suspected to be toxic or unreliable, ADW of known
quality with hardness similar to that of the receiving water may be substituted. Substitution is
(July 2012)

Page 2 of 10

species specific meaning that the decision to use ADW is made for each species and is based on
the toxic response of that particular species. Substitution to an ADW is authorized in two cases.
The first case is when repeating a test due to toxicity in the site dilution water requires an
immediate decision for ADW use by the permittee and toxicity testing laboratory. The second is
when two of the most recent documented incidents of unacceptable site dilution water toxicity
require ADW use in future WET testing.
For the second case, written notification from the permittee requesting ADW use and written
authorization from the permit issuing agency(s) is required prior to switching to a long-term use
of ADW for the duration of the permit.
Written requests for use of ADW must be mailed with supporting documentation to the
following addresses:
Director
Office of Ecosystem Protection (CAA)
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 1
Five Post Office Square, Suite 100
Mail Code OEP06-5
Boston, MA 02109-3912

Mail Code OES04-4
Boston, MA 02109-3912
Note: USEPA Region 1 retains the right to modify any part of the alternate dilution water policy
stated in this protocol at any time. Any changes to this policy will be documented in the annual
DMR posting.
See the most current annual DMR instructions which can be found on the EPA Region 1 website
at http://www.epa.gov/region1/enforcementandassistance/dmr.html for further important details
on alternate dilution water substitution requests.
V. TEST CONDITIONS AND TEST ACCEPTABILITY CRITERIA
EPA Region 1 requires tests be performed using four replicates of each control and effluent
concentration because the non-parametric statistical tests cannot be used with data from fewer
replicates. The following tables summarize the accepted Americamysis and Menidia toxicity test
conditions and test acceptability criteria:

V.1. Test Acceptability Criteria
If a test does not meet TAC the test must be repeated with fresh samples within 30 days of the
initial test completion date.
V.2. Use of Reference Toxicity Testing
Reference toxicity test results and applicable control charts must be included in the toxicity
testing report.
In general, if reference toxicity test results fall outside the control limits established by the
laboratory for a specific test endpoint, a reason or reasons for this excursion must be evaluated,
correction made and reference toxicity tests rerun as necessary as prescribed below.
If a test endpoint value exceeds the control limits at a frequency of more than one out of twenty
then causes for the reference toxicity test failure must be examined and if problems are identified
corrective action taken. The reference toxicity test must be repeated during the same month in
which the exceedance occurred.
If two consecutive reference toxicity tests fall outside control limits, the possible cause(s) for the
exceedance must be examined, corrective actions taken and a repeat of the reference toxicity test
must take place immediately. Actions taken to resolve the problem must be reported.

(July 2012)

Page 7 of 10

V.2.a. Use of Concurrent Reference Toxicity Testing
In the case where concurrent reference toxicity testing is required due to a low frequency of
testing with a particular method, if the reference toxicity test results fall slightly outside of
laboratory established control limits, but the primary test met the TAC, the results of the primary
test will be considered acceptable. However, if the results of the concurrent test fall well outside
the established upper control limits i.e. >3 standard deviations for IC25s and LC50 values and >
two concentration intervals for NOECs or NOAECs, and even though the primary test meets
TAC, the primary test will be considered unacceptable and must be repeated.
VI. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
At the beginning of the static acute test, pH, salinity, and temperature must be measured at the
beginning and end of each 24 hour period in each dilution and in the controls. The following
chemical analyses shall be performed for each sampling event.

NPDES PART II STANDARD CONDITIONS
(April 26, 2018)
A. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Duty to Comply
The Permittee must comply with all conditions of this permit. Any permit noncompliance
constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act (CWA or Act) and is grounds for enforcement
action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or denial of a permit
renewal application.
a. The Permittee shall comply with effluent standards or prohibitions established under
Section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act for toxic pollutants and with standards for sewage
sludge use or disposal established under Section 405(d) of the CWA within the time
provided in the regulations that establish these standards or prohibitions, or standards for
sewage sludge use or disposal, even if the permit has not yet been modified to
incorporate the requirement.
b. Penalties for Violations of Permit Conditions: The Director will adjust the civil and
administrative penalties listed below in accordance with the Civil Monetary Penalty
Inflation Adjustment Rule (83 Fed. Reg. 1190-1194 (January 10, 2018) and the 2015
amendments to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. §
2461 note. See Pub. L.114-74, Section 701 (Nov. 2, 2015)). These requirements help
ensure that EPA penalties keep pace with inflation. Under the above-cited 2015
amendments to inflationary adjustment law, EPA must review its statutory civil penalties
each year and adjust them as necessary.
(1) Criminal Penalties
(a) Negligent Violations. The CWA provides that any person who
negligently violates permit conditions implementing Sections 301, 302,
306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the Act is subject to criminal penalties of
not less than $2,500 nor more than $25,000 per day of violation, or
imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or both. In the case of a second
or subsequent conviction for a negligent violation, a person shall be
subject to criminal penalties of not more than $50,000 per day of
violation or by imprisonment of not more than 2 years, or both.
(b) Knowing Violations. The CWA provides that any person who
knowingly violates permit conditions implementing Sections 301, 302,
306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the Act is subject to a fine of not less than
$5,000 nor more than $50,000 per day of violation, or by imprisonment
for not more than 3 years, or both. In the case of a second or subsequent
conviction for a knowing violation, a person shall be subject to criminal
penalties of not more than $100,000 per day of violation, or
imprisonment of not more than 6 years, or both.
(c) Knowing Endangerment. The CWA provides that any person who
knowingly violates permit conditions implementing Sections 301, 302,
303, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the Act and who knows at that time
that he or she is placing another person in imminent danger of death or
serious bodily injury shall upon conviction be subject to a fine of not
more than $250,000 or by imprisonment of not more than 15 years, or
both. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction for a knowing

Page 2 of 21

NPDES PART II STANDARD CONDITIONS
(April 26, 2018)
endangerment violation, a person shall be subject to a fine of not more
than $500,000 or by imprisonment of not more than 30 years, or both.
An organization, as defined in Section 309(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act,
shall, upon conviction of violating the imminent danger provision, be
subject to a fine of not more than $1,000,000 and can be fined up to
$2,000,000 for second or subsequent convictions.
(d) False Statement. The CWA provides that any person who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or
method required to be maintained under this permit shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, or by
imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or both. If a conviction of a
person is for a violation committed after a first conviction of such
person under this paragraph, punishment is a fine of not more than
$20,000 per day of violation, or by imprisonment of not more than 4
years, or both. The Act further provides that any person who knowingly
makes any false statement, representation, or certification in any record
or other document submitted or required to be maintained under this
permit, including monitoring reports or reports of compliance or noncompliance shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more
than $10,000 per violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 6
months per violation, or by both.
(2) Civil Penalties. The CWA provides that any person who violates a permit
condition implementing Sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the
Act is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed the maximum amounts
authorized by Section 309(d) of the Act, the 2015 amendments to the Federal
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. § 2461 note, and
40 C.F.R. Part 19. See Pub. L.114-74, Section 701 (Nov. 2, 2015); 83 Fed.
Reg. 1190 (January 10, 2018).
(3) Administrative Penalties. The CWA provides that any person who violates a

1. Proper Operation and Maintenance
The Permittee shall at all times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of
treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the Permittee to
achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit. Proper operation and maintenance also
includes adequate laboratory controls and appropriate quality assurance procedures. This
provision requires the operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or similar systems which are
installed by a Permittee only when the operation is necessary to achieve compliance with the
conditions of the permit.
2. Need to Halt or Reduce Not a Defense
It shall not be a defense for a Permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been
necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the
conditions of this permit.
3. Duty to Mitigate
The Permittee shall take all reasonable steps to minimize or prevent any discharge or sludge use
or disposal in violation of this permit which has a reasonable likelihood of adversely affecting

4. Bypass
a. Definitions
(1) Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
treatment facility.
(2) Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
b. Bypass not exceeding limitations. The Permittee may allow any bypass to occur which
does not cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions
of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section.
c. Notice

Page 5 of 21

NPDES PART II STANDARD CONDITIONS
(April 26, 2018)
(1) Anticipated bypass. If the Permittee knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice, if possible at least ten days before the date
of the bypass. As of December 21, 2020 all notices submitted in compliance
with this Section must be submitted electronically by the Permittee to the
Director or initial recipient, as defined in 40 C.F.R. § 127.2(b), in compliance
with this Section and 40 C.F.R. Part 3 (including, in all cases, Subpart D to
Part 3), § 122.22, and 40 C.F.R. Part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo
existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and
independent of Part 127, Permittees may be required to report electronically if
specified by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law.
(2) Unanticipated bypass. The Permittee shall submit notice of an unanticipated
bypass as required in paragraph D.1.e. of this part (24-hour notice). As of
December 21, 2020 all notices submitted in compliance with this Section
must be submitted electronically by the Permittee to the Director or initial
recipient, as defined in 40 C.F.R. § 127.2(b), in compliance with this Section
and 40 C.F.R. Part 3 (including, in all cases, Subpart D to Part 3), § 122.22,
and 40 C.F.R. Part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements
for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of Part 127,
Permittees may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular
permit or required to do so by law.
d. Prohibition of bypass.
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take enforcement action
against a Permittee for bypass, unless:
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering
judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal
periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
(c) The Permittee submitted notices as required under paragraph 4.c
of this Section.
(2) The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse
effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed
above in paragraph 4.d of this Section.
5. Upset
a. Definition. Upset means an exceptional incident in which there is an unintentional and
temporary noncompliance with technology based permit effluent limitations because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the Permittee. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or

Page 6 of 21

NPDES PART II STANDARD CONDITIONS
(April 26, 2018)
improper operation.
b. Effect of an upset. An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with such technology based permit effluent limitations if the
requirements of paragraph B.5.c. of this Section are met. No determination made
during administrative review of claims that noncompliance was caused by upset, and
before an action for noncompliance, is final administrative action subject to judicial
review.
c. Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. A Permittee who wishes to establish
the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and that the Permittee can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(2) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; and
(3) The Permittee submitted notice of the upset as required in paragraph D.1.e.2.b.
(24-hour notice).
(4) The Permittee complied with any remedial measures required under B.3. above.
d. Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the Permittee seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof.

only when:
(1) The alteration or addition to a permitted facility may meet one of the criteria
for determining whether a facility is a new source in 40 C.F.R. § 122.29(b); or
(2) The alteration or addition could significantly change the nature or increase
the quantity of pollutants discharged. This notification applies to pollutants
which are subject neither to effluent limitations in the permit, nor to
notification requirements at 40 C.F.R. § 122.42(a)(1).
(3) The alteration or addition results in a significant change in the Permittee’s
sludge use or disposal practices, and such alteration, addition, or change may
justify the application of permit conditions that are different from or absent in
the existing permit, including notification of additional use or disposal sites
not reported during the permit application process or not reported pursuant to
an approved land application plan.

permit using test procedures approved under 40 C.F.R. § 136, or another
method required for an industry-specific waste stream under 40 C.F.R.
Subchapters N or O, the results of such monitoring shall be included in the
calculation and reporting of the data submitted in the DMR or sludge
reporting form specified by the Director.
(3) Calculations for all limitations which require averaging or measurements
shall utilize an arithmetic mean unless otherwise specified by the Director
in the permit.
e. Twenty-four hour reporting.
(1) The Permittee shall report any noncompliance which may endanger health
or the environment. Any information shall be provided orally within 24
hours from the time the Permittee becomes aware of the circumstances. A
written report shall also be provided within 5 days of the time the Permittee
becomes aware of the circumstances. The written report shall contain a
description of the noncompliance and its cause; the period of
noncompliance, including exact dates and times, and if the noncompliance
has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and
steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the
noncompliance. For noncompliance events related to combined sewer
overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events, these reports must
include the data described above (with the exception of time of discovery)
as well as the type of event (combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer
overflows, or bypass events), type of sewer overflow structure (e.g.,

Proposed Action

Chelsea Sandwich LLC (the Permittee) has applied to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) for reissuance of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit to
discharge from the Chelsea Sandwich Terminal (the Facility) into the Chelsea River.
The permit currently in effect was issued on September 24, 2014, with an effective date of
December 1, 2014, and expired on November 30, 2019, (the 2014 Permit). The 2014 Permit
superseded the permit issued on June 30, 2005 (the 2005 Permit). The Permittee filed an
application for permit reissuance with EPA dated May 29, 2019, as required by 40 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) § 122.6. Since the permit application was deemed timely and
complete by EPA on November 19, 2019, the Facility’s 2014 Permit has been administratively
continued pursuant to 40 CFR § 122.6 and § 122.21(d). EPA and the State conducted a site visit
on December 5, 2019.
2.0

Statutory and Regulatory Authority

Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, codified at 33 U.S.C. § 1251 – 1387
and commonly known as the Clean Water Act (CWA), “to restore and maintain the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.” CWA § 101(a). To achieve this
objective, the CWA makes it unlawful for any person to discharge any pollutant into the waters
of the United States from any point source, except as authorized by specific permitting sections
of the CWA, one of which is § 402. See CWA §§ 301(a), 402(a). Section 402(a) established one
of the CWA’s principal permitting programs, the NPDES Permit Program. Under this section,
EPA may “issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant or combination of pollutants” in
accordance with certain conditions. CWA § 402(a). NPDES permits generally contain discharge
limitations and establish related monitoring and reporting requirements. See CWA § 402(a)(1)
and (2). The regulations governing EPA’s NPDES permit program are generally found in 40
CFR §§ 122, 124, 125, and 136.
“Congress has vested in the Administrator [of EPA] broad discretion to establish conditions for
NPDES permits” in order to achieve the statutory mandates of Section 301 and 402. Arkansas v.
Oklahoma, 503 U.S. 91, 105 (1992). See also 40 CFR §§ 122.4(d), 122.44(d)(1), and
122.44(d)(5). CWA §§ 301 and 306 provide for two types of effluent limitations to be included
in NPDES permits: “technology-based” effluent limitations (TBELs) and “water quality-based”
effluent limitations (WQBELs). See CWA §§ 301, and 304(b); 40 CFR §§ 122, 125, and 131.
Section 402(p) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1342(p) requires stormwater discharges associated with
industrial activity to be authorized by a NPDES permit. See also 40 CFR § 122.26(a)(1)(ii).
2.1

Technology-Based Requirements

Technology-based treatment requirements represent the minimum level of control that must be
imposed under CWA §§ 301(b) and 402 to meet best practicable control technology currently
available (BPT) for conventional pollutants and some metals, best conventional control
technology (BCT) for conventional pollutants, and best available technology economically
achievable (BAT) for toxic and non-conventional pollutants. See 40 CFR § 125 Subpart A.

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 5 of 106

Subpart A of 40 CFR Part 125 establishes criteria and standards for the imposition of
technology-based treatment requirements in permits under § 301(b) of the CWA, including the
application of EPA promulgated Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs) and case-by-case
determinations of effluent limitations under CWA § 402(a)(1). EPA promulgates New Source
Performance Standards (NSPS) under CWA § 306 and 40 CFR § 401.12. See also 40 CFR §§
122.2 (definition of “new source”) and 122.29.
In general, ELGs for non-POTW facilities must be complied with as expeditiously as practicable
but in no case later than three years after the date such limitations are established and in no case
later than March 31, 1989. See 40 CFR § 125.3(a)(2). Compliance schedules and deadlines not in
accordance with the statutory provisions of the CWA cannot be authorized by a NPDES permit.
In the absence of published technology-based effluent guidelines, the permit writer is authorized
under CWA § 402(a)(1)(B) to establish effluent limitations on a case-by-case basis using best
professional judgment (BPJ).
2.2

Water Quality-Based Requirements

The CWA and federal regulations require that effluent limitations based on water quality
considerations be established for point source discharges when such limitations are necessary to
meet state or federal water quality standards that are applicable to the designated receiving water.
This is necessary when less stringent TBELs would interfere with the attainment or maintenance
of water quality criteria in the receiving water. See CWA § 301(b)(1)(C) and 40 CFR
§§ 122.44(d)(1),122.44(d)(5), 125.84(e) and 125.94(i).
2.2.1 Water Quality Standards
The CWA requires that each state develop water quality standards (WQSs) for all water bodies
within the State. See CWA § 303 and 40 CFR §§ 131.10-12. Generally, WQSs consist of three
parts: 1) beneficial designated use or uses for a water body or a segment of a water body; 2)
numeric or narrative water quality criteria sufficient to protect the assigned designated use(s);
and 3) antidegradation requirements to ensure that once a use is attained it will not be degraded
and to protect high quality and National resource waters. See CWA § 303(c)(2)(A) and 40 CFR
§ 131.12. The applicable State WQSs can be found in Title 314 of the Code of Massachusetts
Regulations, Chapter 4 (314 CMR 4.00).
As a matter of state law, state WQSs specify different water body classifications, each of which
is associated with certain designated uses and numeric and narrative water quality criteria. When
using chemical-specific numeric criteria to develop permit limitations, acute and chronic aquatic
life criteria and human health criteria are used and expressed in terms of maximum allowable instream pollutant concentrations. In general, aquatic-life acute criteria are considered applicable
to daily time periods (maximum daily limit) and aquatic-life chronic criteria are considered
applicable to monthly time periods (average monthly limit). Chemical-specific human health
criteria are typically based on lifetime chronic exposure and, therefore, are typically applicable to
monthly average limits.

When permit effluent limitation(s) are necessary to ensure that the receiving water meets
narrative water quality criteria, the permitting authority must establish effluent limits in one of
the following three ways: 1) based on a “calculated numeric criterion for the pollutant which the
permitting authority demonstrates will attain and maintain applicable narrative water quality
criteria and fully protect the designated use,” 2) based on a “case-by-case basis” using CWA
§ 304(a) recommended water quality criteria, supplemented as necessary by other relevant
information; or, 3) in certain circumstances, based on use of an indicator parameter. See 40 CFR
§ 122.44(d)(1)(vi)(A-C).
2.2.2 Antidegradation
Federal regulations found at 40 CFR § 131.12 require states to develop and adopt a statewide
antidegradation policy that maintains and protects existing in-stream water uses and the level of
water quality necessary to protect these existing uses. In addition, the antidegradation policy
ensures maintenance of high quality waters which exceed levels necessary to support
propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and to support recreation in and on the water, unless
the State finds that allowing degradation is necessary to accommodate important economic or
social development in the area in which the waters are located.
Massachusetts’ statewide antidegradation regulations, entitled “Antidegradation Provisions,” are
found in the State’s WQSs at 314 CMR 4.04. The Massachusetts policy for the implementation
of these regulations is in an associated document entitled “Implementation Procedures for the
Antidegradation Provisions of the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards, 314 CMR
4.00” dated October 21, 2009. According to the policy, no lowering of water quality is allowed,
except in accordance with the antidegradation regulations. All existing in-stream designated uses
of a receiving waterbody and the water quality necessary to protect the designated uses must be
maintained and protected.
This permit is being reissued with effluent limitations sufficiently stringent to satisfy the State’s
antidegradation regulations, including the protection of the designated uses of the receiving
water.
2.2.3 Assessment and Listing of Waters and Total Maximum Daily Loads
The objective of the CWA is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological
integrity of the Nation’s waters. To meet this goal, the CWA requires states to develop
information on the quality of their water resources and report this information to EPA, the U.S.
Congress, and the public. To this end, EPA released guidance on November 19, 2001, for the
preparation of an integrated “List of Waters” that could combine reporting elements of both
CWA § 305(b) and § 303(d). The integrated list format allows states to provide the status of all
their assessed waters in one list. States choosing this option must list each water body or segment
in one of the following five categories: 1) unimpaired and not threatened for all designated uses;
2) unimpaired waters for some uses and not assessed for others; 3) insufficient information to
make assessments for any uses; 4) impaired or threatened for one or more uses but not requiring
the calculation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL); and 5) impaired or threatened for one
or more uses and requiring a TMDL.

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 7 of 106

A TMDL is a planning tool and potential starting point for restoration activities with the ultimate
goal of attaining water quality standards. A TMDL essentially provides a pollution budget
designed to restore the health of an impaired water body. A TMDL typically identifies the
source(s) of the pollutant from point sources and non-point sources, determines the maximum
load of the pollutant that the water body can tolerate while still attaining WQSs for the
designated uses, and allocates that load among the various sources, including point source
discharges, subject to NPDES permits. See 40 CFR § 130.7.
For impaired waters where a TMDL has been developed for a particular pollutant and the TMDL
includes a waste load allocation (WLA) for a NPDES permitted discharge, the effluent limitation
in the permit must be “consistent with the assumptions and requirements of any available WLA”.
40 CFR § 122.44(d)(1)(vii)(B).
2.2.4 Reasonable Potential
Pursuant to CWA § 301(b)(1)(C) and 40 CFR § 122.44(d)(1), NPDES permits must contain any
requirements in addition to TBELs that are necessary to achieve water quality standards
established under CWA § 303. See also 33 U.S.C. § 1311(b)(1)(C). In addition, limitations “must
control any pollutant or pollutant parameter (conventional, non-conventional, or toxic) which the
permitting authority determines are or may be discharged at a level which will cause, have the
reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above any water quality standard,
including State narrative criteria for water quality.” 40 CFR § 122.44(d)(1)(i). To determine if
the discharge causes, or has the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above
any WQS, EPA considers: 1) existing controls on point and non-point sources of pollution; 2) the
variability of the pollutant or pollutant parameter in the effluent; 3) the sensitivity of the species
to toxicity testing (when evaluating whole effluent toxicity); and 4) where appropriate, the
dilution of the effluent by the receiving water. See 40 CFR § 122.44(d)(1)(ii).
If the permitting authority determines that the discharge of a pollutant will cause, has the
reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above WQSs, the permit must contain
WQBELs for that pollutant. See 40 CFR § 122.44(d)(1)(i).
2.2.5 State Certification
EPA may not issue a permit unless the State Water Pollution Control Agency with jurisdiction
over the receiving water(s) either certifies that the effluent limitations contained in the permit are
stringent enough to assure that the discharge will not cause the receiving water to violate the
State WQSs, the State waives, or is deemed to have waived, its right to certify. See 33 U.S.C. §
1341(a)(1). Regulations governing state certification are set forth in 40 CFR § 124.53 and §
124.55. EPA has requested permit certification by the State pursuant to 40 CFR § 124.53 and
expects that the Draft Permit will be certified.
If the State believes that conditions more stringent than those contained in the Draft Permit are
necessary to meet the requirements of either CWA §§ 208(e), 301, 302, 303, 306 and 307, or
applicable requirements of State law, the State should include such conditions in its certification

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 8 of 106

and, in each case, cite the CWA or State law provisions upon which that condition is based.
Failure to provide such a citation waives the right to certify as to that condition. EPA includes
properly supported State certification conditions in the NPDES permit. The only exception to
this is that the permit conditions/requirements regulating sewage sludge management and
implementing CWA § 405(d) are not subject to the State certification requirements. Reviews and
appeals of limitations and conditions attributable to State certification shall be made through the
applicable procedures of the State and may not be made through EPA’s permit appeal procedures
of 40 CFR Part 124.
In addition, the State should provide a statement of the extent to which any condition of the Draft
Permit can be made less stringent without violating the requirements of State law. Since the
State’s certification is provided prior to final permit issuance, any failure by the State to provide
this statement waives the State’s right to certify or object to any less stringent condition.
It should be noted that under CWA § 401, EPA’s duty to defer to considerations of State law is
intended to prevent EPA from relaxing any requirements, limitations or conditions imposed by
State law. Therefore, “[a] State may not condition or deny a certification on the grounds that
State law allows a less stringent permit condition.” 40 CFR § 124.55(c). In such an instance, the
regulation provides that, “The Regional Administrator shall disregard any such certification
conditions or denials as waivers of certification.” Id. EPA regulations pertaining to permit
limitations based upon WQSs and State requirements are contained in 40 CFR §§ 122.4(d) and
122.44(d).
2.3

Effluent Flow Requirements

Generally, EPA uses effluent flow both to determine whether an NPDES permit needs certain
effluent limitations and to calculate the effluent limitations themselves. EPA practice is to use
effluent flow as a reasonable and important worst-case condition in EPA’s reasonable potential
and WQBEL calculations to ensure compliance with WQSs under CWA § 301(b)(1)(C). Should
the effluent flow exceed the flow assumed in these calculations, the in-stream dilution would be
reduced, and the calculated effluent limitations might not be sufficiently protective (i.e., might
not meet WQSs). Further, pollutants that do not have the reasonable potential to exceed WQSs at
a lower discharge flow may have reasonable potential at a higher flow due to the decreased
dilution. In order to ensure that the assumptions underlying EPA’s reasonable potential analyses
and permit effluent limitation derivations remain sound for the duration of the permit, EPA may
ensure the validity of its “worst-case” effluent flow assumptions through imposition of permit
conditions for effluent flow.1 In this regard, the effluent flow limitation is a component of
WQBELs because the WQBELs are premised on a maximum level flow. The effluent flow limit
is also necessary to ensure that other pollutants remain at levels that do not have a reasonable
potential to exceed WQSs.

EPA’s regulations regarding “reasonable potential” require EPA to consider “where appropriate, the dilution of the
effluent in the receiving water,” id. 40 CFR §122.44(d)(1)(ii). Both the effluent flow and receiving water flow may
be considered when assessing reasonable potential. In re Upper Blackstone Water Pollution Abatement Dist., 14
E.A.D. 577, 599 (EAB 2010). EPA guidance directs that this “reasonable potential” analysis be based on “worstcase” conditions. See In re Washington Aqueduct Water Supply Sys., 11 E.A.D. 565, 584 (EAB 2004).

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 9 of 106

The limitation on effluent flow is within EPA’s authority to condition a permit to carry out the
objectives and satisfy the requirements of the CWA. See CWA §§ 402(a)(2) and 301(b)(1)(C);
40 CFR §§ 122.4(a) and (d), 122.43, and 122.44(d). A condition on the discharge designed to
ensure the validity of EPA’s WQBELs and reasonable potential calculations that account for
“worst case” conditions is encompassed by the references to “condition” and “limitations” in
CWA §§402 and 301 and the implementing regulations, as WQBELs are designed to assure
compliance with applicable water quality regulations, including antidegradation requirements.
Regulating the quantity of pollutants in the discharge through a restriction on the quantity of
effluent is also consistent with the CWA.
In addition, as provided in Part II.B.1 of this permit and 40 CFR § 122.41(e), the Permittee is
required to properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and control.
Improper operation and maintenance may result in non-compliance with permit effluent
limitations. Consequently, the effluent flow limit is a permit condition that relates to the
Permittee’s duty to mitigate (i.e., minimize or prevent any discharge in violation of the permit
that has a reasonable likelihood of adversely affecting human health or the environment) and to
properly operate and maintain the treatment works. See 40 CFR §§ 122.41(d), (e).
2.4

Monitoring and Reporting Requirements

2.4.1 Monitoring Requirements
Sections 308(a) and 402(a)(2) of the CWA and the implementing regulations at 40 CFR Parts
122, 124, 125, and 136 authorize EPA to include monitoring and reporting requirements in
NPDES permits.
The monitoring requirements included in this permit have been established to yield data
representative of the Facility’s discharges in accordance with CWA §§ 308(a) and 402(a)(2), and
consistent with 40 CFR §§ 122.41(j), 122.43(a), 122.44(i) and 122.48. The Draft Permit specifies
routine sampling and analysis requirements to provide ongoing, representative information on
the levels of regulated constituents in the discharges. The monitoring program is needed to
enable EPA and the State to assess the characteristics of the Facility’s effluent, whether Facility
discharges are complying with permit limits, and whether different permit conditions may be
necessary in the future to ensure compliance with technology-based and water quality-based
standards under the CWA. EPA and/or the State may use the results of the chemical analyses
conducted pursuant to this permit, as well as national water quality criteria developed pursuant to
CWA § 304(a)(1), State water quality criteria, and any other appropriate information or data, to
develop numerical effluent limitations for any pollutants, including, but not limited to, those
pollutants listed in Appendix D of 40 CFR Part 122.
NPDES permits require that the approved analytical procedures found in 40 CFR Part 136 be
used for sampling and analysis unless other procedures are explicitly specified. Permits also
include requirements necessary to comply with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES): Use of Sufficiently Sensitive Test Methods for Permit Applications and

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 10 of 106

Reporting Rule. 2 This Rule requires that where EPA-approved methods exist, NPDES applicants
must use sufficiently sensitive EPA-approved analytical methods when quantifying the presence
of pollutants in a discharge. Further, the permitting authority must prescribe that only sufficiently
sensitive EPA-approved methods be used for analyses of pollutants or pollutant parameters under
the permit. The NPDES regulations at 40 CFR § 122.21(e)(3) (completeness), 40 CFR §
122.44(i)(1)(iv) (monitoring requirements) and/or as cross referenced at 40 CFR § 136.1(c)
(applicability) indicate that an EPA-approved method is sufficiently sensitive where:
•
•

•

The method minimum level 3 (ML) is at or below the level of the effluent limitation
established in the permit for the measured pollutant or pollutant parameter; or
In the case of permit applications, the ML is above the applicable water quality criterion,
but the amount of the pollutant or pollutant parameter in a facility’s discharge is high
enough that the method detects and quantifies the level of the pollutant or parameter in
the discharge; or
The method has the lowest ML of the analytical methods approved under 40 CFR Part
136 or required under 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N or O for the measured pollutant or
pollutant parameter.

2.4.2 Reporting Requirements
The Draft Permit requires the Permittee to report monitoring results obtained during each
calendar month to EPA and the State electronically using NetDMR. The Permittee must submit a
Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) for each calendar month no later than the 15th day of the
month following the completed reporting period.
NetDMR is a national web-based tool enabling regulated CWA permittees to submit DMRs
electronically via a secure internet application to EPA through the Environmental Information
Exchange Network. NetDMR has eliminated the need for participants to mail in paper forms to
EPA under 40 CFR §§ 122.41 and 403.12. NetDMR is accessible through EPA’s Central Data
Exchange at https://cdx.epa.gov/. Further information about NetDMR can be found on EPA’s
NetDMR support portal webpage.4
With the use of NetDMR, the Permittee is no longer required to submit hard copies of DMRs and
reports to EPA and the State unless otherwise specified in the Draft Permit. In most cases,
reports required under the permit shall be submitted to EPA as an electronic attachment through
NetDMR. Certain exceptions are provided in the permit such as for providing written
notifications required under the Part II Standard Conditions.
Fed. Reg. 49,001 (Aug. 19, 2014).
The term “minimum level” refers to either the sample concentration equivalent to the lowest calibration point in a
method or a multiple of the method detection limit (MDL), whichever is higher. Minimum levels may be obtained in
several ways: They may be published in a method; they may be based on the lowest acceptable calibration point
used by a laboratory; or they may be calculated by multiplying the MDL in a method, or the MDL determined by a
laboratory, by a factor. EPA is considering the following terms related to analytical method sensitivity to be
synonymous: “quantitation limit,” “reporting limit,” “level of quantitation,” and “minimum level.” See Fed. Reg.
49,001 (Aug. 19, 2014).

Standard Conditions

The Standard Conditions, included as Part II of the Draft Permit, are based on applicable
regulations found in the Code of Federal Regulations. See generally 40 CFR Part 122.
2.6

Anti-backsliding

The CWA’s anti-backsliding requirements prohibit a permit from being renewed, reissued or
modified to include less stringent limitations or conditions than those contained in a previous
permit except in compliance with one of the specified exceptions to those requirements. See
CWA §§ 402(o) and 303(d)(4) and 40 CFR § 122.44(l). Anti-backsliding provisions apply to
effluent limits based on technology, water quality, and/or State certification requirements.
All proposed limitations in the Draft Permit are at least as stringent as limitations included in the
2014 Permit unless specific conditions exist to justify relaxation in accordance with CWA
§ 402(o) or § 303(d)(4). Discussion of any less stringent limitations and corresponding
exceptions to anti-backsliding provisions is provided in the sections that follow.

Description of Facility and Discharge

3.1

Location and Type of Facility

The Facility, a bulk oil terminal involved in the receipt, storage, and distribution of petroleum
products, is located on about 10-acres between the Chelsea River and Broadway and Front Street
in the Admirals Hill neighborhood in Chelsea, Massachusetts. The Facility is located along the
northern bank of the Chelsea River at the confluence with the Mystic River. The Facility consists
of a marine vessel dock, a tank farm consisting of aboveground petroleum storage tanks, and a
terminal yard, including a truck loading rack, various buildings, and paved areas. A location map
is provided in Figure 1.
The Facility receives bulk quantities of petroleum products via ship or barge at the marine vessel
dock, except a limited inventory transported by tanker truck. The bulk unloading facilities are
located on the Mystic River, on the southwest side of the Facility site. Product is then transferred
to aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) located within the tank farm. The ASTs are situated within
secondary containment areas. There are no underground storage tanks (USTs) at the Facility. The
Facility can store a gross capacity of approximately 670,000 barrels (or 28,000,000 gallons) of
product. The Facility handles petroleum fuels including diesel, No. 2 and No. 6 fuel oils, fuel
additives, and biofuels. The Facility has the capability of physically blending some of these
products together to market products (e.g., No. 4 fuel oil, bio-diesel and bio-heating oil). The
Facility also stores small quantities of kerosene. A site plan is provided in Figure 2.
The marine vessel dock is located along a rip-rap embankment at the confluence of the Mystic
and Chelsea Rivers. The dock is equipped with a manifold area for receipt and distribution of
product. The bulk of the product received at the Facility is off-loaded at the dock from ship or
barge. Petroleum products are transferred to the ASTs via above ground dock lines. Stored fuel

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 12 of 106

oil products are distributed either via the truck loading racks, the marine dock, or via fueling
stations located at the marine vessel dock.
The truck loading rack is located along Broadway at the street entrance to the Facility. It consists
of a total of 17 loading locations, with 15 top loading and two bottom loading positions. The
Facility operates seven pump off stations to off load product from tanker trucks. Two are actively
used and are constructed with secondary containment.
The tank farm, which encompasses approximately two acres, is located along the western edge of
the Facility property adjacent to the Mystic River. The tank farm contains nine bulk ASTs, two
20,000-gallon horizontal steel ASTs, three smaller 500-gallon fuel additive tanks, and a
groundwater remediation system trailer. The tank farm is surrounded by a concrete secondary
containment wall. The tank farm has a capacity to hold the contents of the largest bulk storage
tank and sufficient freeboard for precipitation (an additional 10 percent of the volume of the
largest tank or the volume of a 24 hour, 25-year storm event).
On December 17, 2019, a bio-diesel tank located in the tank farm containing approximately
1,500 gallons of cooking oil overheated and caught fire (Tank 110; approx. 30,000-gallon
capacity). The fire was extinguished primarily using a water fog along with a small amount of
aqueous film-forming fire-fighting foam. According to the Permittee, the volumes of water and
foam used were minimal. Once the fire was extinguished, the bio-diesel product and impacted
water were contained and recovered. Gravel and soil within the impacted area were subsequently
excavated. Tank 110 has been removed from the site. Two new, replacement bio-fuel tanks were
installed at the site. They were installed to replace Tank 110, which was taken out of service in
December 2019 and subsequently removed from the site along with Tank 111, which was also
empty at that time. These tanks are double walled steel tanks each with a 20,000-gallon capacity
and also numbered 110 and 111.5
The terminal yard, which encompasses approximately 3.5 acres, consists of a smaller tank farm
with five ASTs, each having their own secondary containment, and 14 ASTs ranging in size
from several hundred gallons to several thousand gallons, two of which are not in use. The
secondary containment for this tank farm area is provided through interconnected steel
containment dikes which surround each tank. The steel walled containment dikes are designed to
hold the contents of the largest bulk AST and sufficient freeboard for precipitation (10 percent of
the volume of the largest tank or the volume of a 24 hour, 25-year storm event). The smaller
tanks are primarily used to store fuel additives, heating oil, kerosene, and diesel fuel for the
Facility’s own use.
The areas of the terminal yard outside of secondary containment include paved access ways, a
parking lot, an administration building, a garage and truck wash bay, a boiler house, a foam
house, a blending house (product blending units and a regenerative thermal oxidizer), a truck
loading rack, seven truck pump-off stations, and the treatment system for Outfall 001, consisting
of an oil/water separator (OWS). A second two-story office building, a truck maintenance garage
and a large parking lot are located in the northeast corner of the terminal yard.

3.1.1 Effluent Limitation Guidelines
EPA has not promulgated technology-based ELGs for petroleum bulk stations and terminals
(SIC 5171) in 40 CFR Subchapter N Parts 405 through 471 for the discharge of pollutants from
petroleum bulk stations and terminals. Therefore, in accordance with CWA § 402(a)(1)(B) and
40 CFR § 125.3(c)(2), EPA may establish effluent limitations on a case-by-case basis using BPJ.
The NPDES regulations in 40 CFR § 125.3(c)(2) state that permits developed on a case-by-case
basis under CWA § 402 (a)(1) shall apply the appropriate factors listed in 40 CFR § 125.3(d) and
must consider 1) the appropriate technology for the category class of point sources of which the
applicant is a member, based on available information, and 2) any unique factors relating to the
applicant.
To the extent applicable to the Facility, EPA considered the following information from other
ELGs and/or NPDES permits.
•

EPA promulgated technology-based ELGs for the Steam Electric Point Source Category
in 1974, and amended the regulations in 1977, 1978, 1980, 1982 and 2015. See 40 CFR
423. This regulation applies to discharges resulting from the operation of a generating
unit by an establishment whose generation of electricity is the predominant source of
revenue or principal reason for operation, and whose generation of electricity results
primarily from a process utilizing fossil-type fuel (coal, oil, or gas), fuel derived from
fossil fuel (e.g., petroleum coke, synthesis gas), or nuclear fuel in conjunction with a
thermal cycle employing the steam water system as the thermodynamic medium. EPA
considered ELGs for facilities that utilize tank farms for bulk fuel storage.

•

EPA’s Technical Support Document for the 2004 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan. 6 In
2003, EPA evaluated whether a new subcategory, petroleum bulk stations and terminals
(SIC 5171), was appropriate under the Petroleum Refining Point Source Category. See
CWA Section 304(b). EPA deferred the development of effluent guidelines for petroleum
bulk stations and terminals as a new subcategory under 40 CFR Part 419. EPA
considered pollutant sources and/or control measures described in its case-by-case
evaluation of technology-based effluent limitations.

Location and Type of Discharge

Outfall 001 is located at Latitude 42º 23’ 7.4898” N Longitude -71º 02’ 40.844” W adjacent to
the approximately 300-foot marine vessel dock. The discharge consists of 1) stormwater runoff;
2) hydrostatic test water; 3) groundwater remediation effluent from Outfall 002; and 4) boiler
blowdown. Outfall 002 is an internal outfall located at Latitude 42º 23’ 8.9154” N Longitude 71º 02’ 42.681” W. A site plan for the Facility and the locations of Outfall 001 and internal
Outfall 002 is provided in Figure 2.
Stormwater
Stormwater is collected at the Terminal in the following areas: 1) marine vessel dock; 2) terminal
yard; and 3) terminal field. Stormwater runoff from each of these areas is visually inspected,
drained separately and treated through the OWS prior to discharging to the Chelsea River via
Outfall 001. Stormwater collected inside the secondary containment areas is visually inspected
for product or an oil sheen before it is released from the containment to the stormwater catch
basins located in the terminal yard. If product or oil sheen is visually detected, the stormwater is
not released to the stormwater conveyance system and is instead either treated on site or disposed
of offsite.
The marine vessel dock is equipped with a drip pan that collects any fuel leaked from overhead
fuel transfer hose(s). Contents of the drip pan are disposed of in accordance with applicable
regulations. The floor of the vessel dock is shaped like a shallow cone. Stormwater that
accumulates along the floor of the marine vessel dock is transferred manually via an
insulated pipeline into the terminal yard and directed to the stormwater collection
system. The Draft Permit prohibits discharges of stormwater from the dock directly to the
Chelsea River.
The tank farm area of the terminal yard is located within secondary containment, constructed of
steel or concrete walls supported by concrete foundations. Stormwater collection sumps are
located within the secondary contaminant of three of the five ASTs in the tank farm.
Accumulated stormwater within these containment areas is either transferred to a concrete dike
containment area or discharged directly into adjacent stormwater catch basins. Stormwater
accumulated within the earthen floor containment dikes for the two additional tanks either
evaporates and/or infiltrates into the ground and/or is drained through removable flow control
plugs into the stormwater conveyance system via nearby catch basins. Four additional tanks in
the terminal yard are constructed with individual concrete containment structures. Each is
equipped with a floor drain plug or control valve that are manually operated to gravity drain
stormwater to the OWS.
Stormwater collected on the parking lot and paved areas of the terminal yard (approximately four
acres) collects in nearby catch basins. Stormwater, if necessary, can be stored in this area by

in the terminal yard are equipped with a concrete containment structure designed to collect minor
leaks that may occur during fuel transfer. Stormwater collected in the concrete containment
structure of one of these stations is confined inside the secondary containment and has no
drainage provisions. The second station has secondary containment with a drain plug that
discharges stormwater to the underground stormwater conveyance system. The remaining
stations are associated with individual tanks and are rarely used. Stormwater runoff from the
paved truck loading rack area (approximately ½ acre) flows to a perimeter drain that
encompasses approximately two-thirds of the loading area. A canopy roof covering the truck
loading rack directs precipitation away from loading equipment towards and into the perimeter
drains. Stormwater runoff that is not captured by the perimeter drain travels toward lower
elevation catch basins located in the vicinity of the loading area. The stormwater runoff collected
by the perimeter drain enters the underground stormwater conveyance system via a manway
located near the entrance of the foam house. This man way also acts as an isolation point for the
perimeter drains. The stormwater collection system carries the runoff by gravity to the OWS
prior to discharging into the Chelsea River via Outfall 001.
The terminal field located on the west side of the Terminal property encompasses approximately
2 acres. Stormwater runoff within the terminal field is directed overland towards a shallow lift
station located between Tanks 104 and 105. The lift station has a gate valve and a float control
activated pump which are manually operated. The control switch for the pump is maintained in
the off position at all times, except when operating the pump to discharge accumulated
stormwater. Stormwater from the lift station is pumped over the secondary containment wall into
the underground stormwater collection system via a catch basin located outside the terminal
field. Stormwater entering the underground collection system from the terminal field then flows
by gravity to the OWS and discharges into the Chelsea River via Outfall 001.
The OWS is an open underground steel wall structure having two chambers. The first chamber is
for stormwater collection and treatment, and the second chamber is a pumping station. To
increase efficiency of the OWS, the stormwater collection chamber is equipped with coalescing
packs. Coalescing packs enhance the floating product and oil sheen removal efficiency, while
additionally increasing the settlement of suspended solids. The pumping station is equipped with
two discharge pumps. Pumps are used to lift treated water from the OWS and discharge it via
Outfall 001. In 2017, as a precaution to prevent against any future high tidal water entering into
the OWS, a three (3)-foot high steel collar wall was installed around the perimeter the OWS. The
OWS is emptied, cleaned and inspected for integrity on a minimum annual basis. Discharge from
the OWS is metered and recorded monthly.
Hydrostatic Test Water
The aboveground storage tanks are subject to annual external inspections (502 CMR 5.00) and
their integrity is certified annually by a licensed tank inspector. Internal inspections of the above
ground storage tanks are conducted every 10 years. The testing procedures are detailed in API
653 Standard. In addition, repairs are occasionally made at the Terminal to tanks and piping used
for the storage and conveyance of petroleum products and additives. To ensure safe working
conditions during this maintenance work, storage tanks and/or pipe networks are rigorously

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 16 of 106

cleaned (e.g. “Poly Brushed”, “Squeegee Pigged”) and certified as being product-free. After
completing certain maintenance work, the tanks and/or piping may be hydrostatically tested for
leaks. Hydrostatic testing involves filling the tank or pipe with water under pressure and
monitoring pressure drops over time. If the system maintains a constant pressure, there are no
leaks. River water or potable water may be used as a source of hydrostatic test water. Thus,
hydrostatic test water discharge may contain minimal amounts of foreign matter, trace amounts
of hydrocarbons, background material found in the river, or residual chlorine. Hydrostatic test
water is released from tanks and/or piping only after testing demonstrates that the water quality
is consistent with the effluent limitations and requirements of the permit. Hydrostatic test water
is processed through the Facility’s treatment system prior to discharge to the Chelsea River
through Outfall 001.
Groundwater Remediation Effluent
The 2005 Permit established internal Outfall 002 for the discharge of groundwater remediation
effluent. A groundwater treatment system was installed in November 2003 and is operated to
recover fuel oil from a historical spill regulated under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan
(MCP) (310 CMR 40.0000). The groundwater system consists of nine recovery wells installed
within and adjacent to the terminal field tank farm: three in the terminal yard and six inside the
terminal field. Recovery wells located in the terminal yard are inactive. Of the six recovery wells
installed inside the terminal field, four are currently in use. The average flow rate generated by
the four recovery wells is 7 to 8 gallons per minute (GPM). However, the treatment system has
the potential to treat a maximum design flow capacity of 25 GPM.
Groundwater is pumped from the recovery wells to a treatment system consisting of an OWS, a
cartridge filter bag, and two 1,000-pound granulated activated carbon (GAC) units in series.
Treated groundwater is discharged via Outfall 002 into the lift station sump located in the
terminal field. The sump also collects stormwater runoff accumulated inside the terminal field.
Treated groundwater and any stormwater in the lift station is pumped to the Terminal’s OWS
prior to discharge to the Chelsea River via Outfall 001. At one time, the groundwater treatment
system also included use of an air stripper to remove VOCs from groundwater. Monitoring data
demonstrated concentrations of VOCs were not detected in the recovered groundwater. Thus, use
of air stripper was discontinued. Internal Outfall 002 was established upstream of the stormwater
treatment system and Outfall 001 to ensure that monitoring results reflect the characteristics of
the remediation waste stream and not the stormwater, hydrostatic test water, and boiler
blowdown with which it is being mixed (see 40 CFR §122.45(h)).
Boiler Blowdown
Chelsea Sandwich operates two boilers to generate steam used to heat several buildings located
at the Terminal. Steam is also used to heat No.6 fuel oil to lower the viscosity and to heat
biofuels to prevent the product from solidifying. Typically, a small volume of water is withdrawn
from the boilers on a daily basis as part of the required operation and maintenance. This
discharge, or “boiler blowdown” is required to prevent the potential buildup of naturally
occurring mineral salts inside the boiler’s heat transfer tubes that can lead to corrosion. In
addition, a small volume of steam condensate is generated.

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 17 of 106

Boiler blowdown and steam condensate discharges are intermittent, of short duration (typically
seconds), occur in small volumes (approximately ½ gallon maximum), and at high pressures (up
to 1200 pounds per square inch). The discharge consists of water and steam or water that may
contain metals or feed water corrosion inhibitors (i.e., water softeners) that are added to the
boiler. The terminal discharges approximately one-half gallon per day of boiler blowdown into
the stormwater collection system.
A quantitative description of the discharge in terms of effluent parameters, based on monitoring
data submitted by the Permittee, including Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs), from
December 1, 2014 through October 31, 2020, is provided in Appendix A of this Fact Sheet. 9

Description of Receiving Water and Dilution
Receiving Water

The Facility discharges through Outfall 001 to Chelsea River Segment (MA71-06), which flows
from the east or west along the northern edge of the Facility site, depending on the tidal stage.
This segment is 0.37 square miles between the confluence with Mill Creek, in Chelsea/Revere to
the confluence with Boston Inner Harbor, in Chelsea/East Boston/Charlestown. The Facility is
located approximately 0.5 miles east of the inlet to Chelsea River at the confluence with the
Mystic River and Boston Inner Harbor.
Chelsea River is classified as Class SB (CSO). Class SB waters are described in the
Massachusetts Surface WQSs at 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b) as follows: “These waters are designated
as a habitat for fish, other aquatic life and wildlife, including for their reproduction, migration,
growth and other critical functions, and for primary and secondary contact recreation. In
certain waters, habitat for fish, other aquatic life and wildlife may include, but is not limited to,
seagrass…These waters shall have consistently good aesthetic value.” The Chelsea River is one
of eleven Designated Port Areas (DPAs) established by the Massachusetts Office of Coastal
Zone Management to promote and protect water-dependent industrial uses. The Chelsea River is
part of the Mystic River Basin and the Boston Harbor Drainage Area.
Chelsea River is listed in the Massachusetts Year 2016 Integrated List of Waters (303(d) List) as
a Category 5 “Waters Requiring a TMDL. 10 The pollutants and conditions requiring a TMDL are
ammonia (un-ionized), fecal coliform, dissolved oxygen, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in
fish tissue, petroleum hydrocarbons, sediment screening value, odor, and turbidity. This segment
is also impaired for debris/floatables/trash, but this is considered a non-pollutant and does not

Additional monitoring data submitted by the Permittee (i.e., DMRs) since November 30, 2019 was reviewed by
EPA for consistency with the data for the monitoring period from December 1, 2014 through November 30, 2019,
which is the date range used to determine the effluent limitations and conditions proposed in the Draft Permit. EPA
finds that the additional monitoring data are consistent and as a result, no changes to the proposed effluent
limitations and conditions are warranted. Therefore, these data are not included in Appendix A of this Fact Sheet.

the sources of these impairments as aboveground storage tank leaks (from tank farms), accidental
releases/spills and/or cargo loading/unloading associated with bulk petroleum terminals, and
municipal sources (i.e., an urbanized high-density area). In the instance of the Aquatic Life and
Aesthetics uses, the WQAR additionally notes contamination of groundwater as a result of
petroleum releases. Pollutants related to materials currently and/or historically present at the
Facility are explicitly listed as the cause of these impairments, and the sources of these pollutants
have been attributed to one or more activities that occur at the Facility. Regarding contaminated
sediments as an additional cause of the Aquatic Life impairment, a 2005 United States

Geological Survey study identified chemicals present in sufficiently high concentrations in
Chelsea River sediment to pose a threat to benthic organisms. 12 The Fish Consumption and
Shellfishing Designated Uses are not supporting as a result of PCBs in fish tissue and fecal

Ambient Data

A summary of the ambient data collected in the receiving water in the vicinity of the Facility that
are referenced in this Fact Sheet can be found in Appendix B of this Fact Sheet. Ambient data
consist of the following:
•
•
•

Receiving water chemical analysis conducted in accordance with Whole Effluent
Toxicity testing requirements included in the 2014 Permit, conducted by the Permittee.
Pollutant scan receiving water analysis requirements included in the 2014 Permit,
conducted by the Permittee.
Water quality data from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority’s (MWRA)
monitoring program for sampling location 027, located near the Facility on Chelsea
River.

Results indicate that, overall, the pollutants included in the monitoring required in the 2014
Permit are generally not present in the vicinity of the Facility’s outfall. Pollutants detected on at
least one occasion from December 1, 2014 through November 30, 2019 in the vicinity of
Outfalls 001 were as follows:

Metals: copper, lead, nickel, and zinc.
Available Dilution

To ensure that discharges do not cause or contribute to violations of WQSs under all expected
conditions, WQBELs are derived assuming critical conditions for the receiving water.13
The critical flow in marine and coastal waters is determined on a case-by-case basis. State WQSs
specify that, “the Department will establish extreme hydrologic conditions at which aquatic life
criteria must be applied on a case-by-case basis. In all cases existing uses shall be protected and
the selection shall not interfere with the attainment of designated uses.” See 314 CMR 4.03(3)(c).

State WQSs further specify that, “human health-based criteria may be applied at conditions the
Department determines will result in protection at least equivalent to that provided for rivers and
streams.” See 314 CMR 4.03(3)(d). The State determined that the dilution factor for the Facility
is zero (i.e., 1:1). EPA used this dilution factor (DF) in its quantitative derivation of WQBELs
for pollutants in the Draft Permit.

Description of Effluent Limitations and Conditions

The proposed effluent limitations and conditions derived under the CWA and State WQSs are
described below. These proposed effluent limitations and conditions, the bases of which are
discussed throughout this Fact Sheet, may be found in Part I of the Draft Permit.
The State and Federal regulations, data regarding discharge characteristics, and data regarding
ambient characteristics described above, were used during the effluent limitation development
process. Discharge and ambient data are included in Appendix A and B. EPA’s Reasonable
Potential Analysis for chemical-specific parameters is included in Appendix C and results are
discussed in the sections below.
In accordance with 40 CFR § 122.45(b)(2), EPA determined that the measure of production
appropriate for this Facility is the design flow of the treatment system. For the purposes of this
permit, design flow is defined as the maximum flow rate through the treatment component with
the lowest capacity based on the specifications as reported by the Permittee. The design flow
reflects the magnitude, frequency and duration of discharges treated within the specifications of
the treatment system in use. EPA based this design flow on the treatment system specifications
reported by the Permittee.
5.1

Indicator Parameters

During the development of the 2005, and/or 2014 Permits, EPA identified common groups of
pollutants present or likely present at this and similar facilities. Further, EPA determined that it
would be both impractical and unnecessary to attempt to evaluate and limit every possible
individual pollutant among these common groups of pollutants. As a result, EPA determined that
limiting “indicator parameters” in accordance with 40 CFR § 122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C) is reasonable
and sufficiently stringent to carry out the provisions of the CWA and ensure compliance with
applicable WQSs as required by CWA §401(a)(2) and 40 CFR §122.4(d).
For this Draft Permit, EPA maintains that:
•
•
•

The Draft Permit identifies indicator parameters and which pollutants are intended to be
controlled using the effluent limitations for these indicator parameters;
This Fact Sheet sets forth the basis for the limitations, and finds that compliance with the
effluent limitations on the indicator parameters will result in controls on the pollutants of
concern which are sufficient to attain and maintain applicable WQSs;
The Draft Permit requires effluent and ambient monitoring necessary for EPA to evaluate
whether the limitations on the indicator parameters meet applicable WQSs; and

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280
•

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 21 of 106

The Draft Permit contains a reopener clause allowing EPA to modify or revoke and
reissue the permit if the limitations on the indicator parameters no longer attain and
maintain applicable WQSs.

EPA selected indicator parameters that: 1) are more common (i.e., more frequently detected in
effluent from this and similar facilities); 2) are more toxic (e.g., priority pollutants in Appendix
A to 40 CFR §423); 3) exhibit limiting physical and/or chemical characteristics with respect to
susceptibility to treatment by pollution control technologies; and/or 4) exhibit physical and/or
chemical characteristics strongly representative of other pollutants, which ensures that other
pollutants with similar characteristics would also be removed by pollution control technologies.
Therefore, effluent limitations established to control indicator parameters, also control the
pollutants the indicator parameters represent. EPA has grouped most indicator parameters, as
shown below and described in the sections that follow. Stand-alone parameters included in the
Draft Permit are noted as such (e.g., effluent flow, pH, ammonia).
•
•
•
•
•

Conventional Pollutants
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds (SVOCs)
Chemicals and Additives
Metals

The majority of indicator parameters included in the Draft Permit are unchanged from the
indicator parameters included in the 2014 Permit. However, EPA has added, revised or removed
indicator parameters if necessary and appropriate. The following sections describe the indicator
parameters and the basis for the effluent limitations or monitor-only requirements for the
selected indicator parameters, including justification for removal, if applicable.
5.2

Proposed Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements for Outfall 001

5.2.1 Effluent Flow
OWSs are the typical minimum treatment technology employed by petroleum bulk storage
terminals for treatment of stormwater runoff. These devices use gravity to separate lower-density
oils from water, resulting in an oil phase above the oil/water interface and a heavier particulate
phase on the bottom of the separator. The sizing of an OWS is based upon the flow rate, density
of oil to be separated, desired percent removal of oil, and the operating temperature range. The
OWS for Outfall 001 has a design flow capacity of 700 gallons per minute (GPM). Stormwater
runoff, hydrostatic test water, groundwater remediation effluent and boiler blowdown discharge
to the Chelsea River through Outfall 001 after treatment.
From December 1, 2014, through October 31, 2020, the total monthly flow reported for Outfall
001 ranged from 0.012 to 1.2915 million gallons (Mgal) and the total monthly flow reported for
Outfall 002 ranged from 0.017 to 0.129 Mgal. The daily maximum flow rate reported for this
period was 175 GPM (0.25 MGD) for Outfall 001 for each month in which flow was recorded.
The daily maximum flow rate reported for this period was 25 GPM (0.04 MGD) for Outfall 002
each month.

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 22 of 106

The Draft Permit maintains the daily maximum flow rate limit of 700 GPM for Outfall 001 and
25 GPM for Outfall 002 as well as weekly monitoring for flow using a totalizer or similar device,
when the Facility is discharging. The Draft Permit also maintains the reporting requirements for
total flow per month for Outfall 001 and 002 and total number of discharge events per month for
Outfall 002, in order to accurately characterize the magnitude and frequency of discharges from
the Facility going forward. The Draft Permit requires effluent sampling during periods of
discharge from the OWS and not necessarily during periods associated with a specific
precipitation event. The Permittee must document the measures and methods used to control
flow through the stormwater treatment systems in its Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP). See Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2, below.
5.2.2 Conventional Pollutants
5.2.2.1 Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
Solids could include inorganic (e.g., silt, sand, clay, and insoluble hydrated metal oxides) and
organic matter (e.g., flocculated colloids and compounds that contribute to color). Solids can
clog fish gills, resulting in an increase in susceptibility to infection or asphyxiation. Suspended
solids can increase turbidity in receiving waters and reduce light penetration through the water
column or settle to form bottom deposits in the receiving water. Suspended solids also provide a
medium for the transport of other adsorbed pollutants, such as metals, which may accumulate in
settled deposits that can have a long-term impact on the water column through cycles of resuspension.
The 2014 Permit included a daily maximum effluent limit of 100 mg/L and a monthly average
effluent limit of 30 mg/L for TSS, monitored twice per month. From December 1, 2014 through
October 31, 2020, daily maximum TSS levels have ranged from below laboratory minimum
levels to 132 mg/L at Outfall 001 with this maximum value being the only limit exceedance.
In establishing the technology-based limits in the 2005 permit, and continuing these limits in the
2014 Permit, EPA considered similar facilities and the Facility’s use of an OWS. In the
technology guidelines promulgated at 40 CFR § 423 for the Steam Electric Power Point Source
Category, the storage of fuel oil at steam electric facilities at the time the technology guidelines
were promulgated was similar to the storage of petroleum products at bulk stations and
terminals. In developing effluent limits for the Steam Electric Power Point Source Category,
EPA considered the level of treatment that could be technologically achieved for TSS using an
OWS and set corresponding limits in the guidelines. 14 See 40 CFR § 423.12(b)(3) and (12). EPA
identified TSS as a potential pollutant due to the drainage associated with equipment containing
fuel oil and/or the leakage associated with the storage of oil.15 In reviewing the technology-based
limits for TSS for the Draft Permit, EPA determined that operations at the Facility remain
consistent with the conditions under which the technology guidelines promulgated at 40 CFR §
See Steam Electric Power Generating Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. 39 Fed. Reg. 36186 (October 8,
1974).
15
See Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards and Pretreatment Standards for
the Steam Electric Point Source Category. EPA-440-1-82-029. Washington, DC. (November 1982).

423 can be achieved. Furthermore, EPA determined that the TSS limits in the Draft Permit are
similar to technology-based limits established for other facilities in Region 1 and similar
facilities in other regions, as described in the ELG documents cited above.
The Draft Permit maintains the maximum daily limit of 100 mg/L, and the average monthly limit
of 30 mg/L for Outfall 001, monitored twice per month, consistent with anti-backsliding
requirements found in 40 CFR § 122.44(l).
5.2.2.2 Turbidity
Turbidity is a measure of relative water clarity, with relatively higher turbidity corresponding to
relatively lower water clarity. Materials such as inorganic matter (e.g., silt, sand, and clay),
organisms (e.g., algae, plankton, and microbes), and detritus can contribute turbidity. Highly
turbid water can influence the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water by decreasing light
penetration in the water, in turn reducing photosynthesis, by increasing water temperature as
suspended particles absorb heat, or by oxygen depletion as bacteria consume dead plant matter.
These materials can also have physical effects on aquatic life and waterbodies, clogging fish
gills, reducing growth and disease resistance, smothering fish eggs and benthic
macroinvertebrates, and causing sedimentation that may alter the nature of bottom sediments.
State WQSs for color and turbidity for Class SB waters states, “These waters shall be free from
color and turbidity in concentrations or combinations that are aesthetically objectionable or
would impair any use assigned to this class.” 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)6. A turbidity value of 25 NTU
is consistent with the upstream turbidity cited in EPA’s Quality Criteria for Water to explain
major increases in stream suspended solids. 16 Impacts to aquatic life from elevated sediment and
turbidity can take place both through direct mortality in the short term and reduced reproductive
success in the long term.17 This value is also consistent with several states that have established
numeric water quality criteria for turbidity, including the New England states of Vermont 18 and
New Hampshire. 19
EPA has determined turbidity is a pollutant of concern under State WQSs for color and turbidity
at 314 CMR 4.05(4(b)6, for aesthetics at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(a) and for bottom pollutants or
alterations at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(b), given: 1) the Facility operation, which involves the treatment
of solids; 2) the occasionally elevated levels of TSS measured in the discharge; 3) turbidity is a
listed cause of the aesthetics and primary and secondary contact impairments in the Chelsea
River; and 4) turbidity is a pollutant that requires a TMDL in the Chelsea River. However,
turbidity concentrations have not been measured in the Facility’s discharges. Therefore, the Draft
Permit contains daily maximum and monthly average monitoring for turbidity in nephelometric

turbidity units (NTUs) for Outfall 001, monitored twice per month by grab samples, in
conjunction with TSS sampling.
This information is necessary to determine if discharges of turbidity from the Facility cause, or
have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above State WQSs in
accordance with 40 CFR §122.44(d)(1)(ii).
5.2.2.3 pH
The hydrogen-ion concentration in an aqueous solution is represented by the pH using a
logarithmic scale of 0 to 14 standard units (S.U.). Solutions with pH 7.0 S.U. are neutral, while
those with pH less than 7.0 S.U. are acidic and those with pH greater than 7.0 S.U. are basic.
Discharges with pH values markedly different from the receiving water pH can have a
detrimental effect on the environment. Sudden pH changes can kill aquatic life. pH can also have
an indirect effect on the toxicity of other pollutants in the water.
From December 1, 2014 through October 31, 2020 (Appendix A), pH has ranged from 6.55 SU
to 9.44 SU for Outfall 001 and 6.42 SU to 7.76 SU for Outfall 002, with one violation for each
outfall. The Draft Permit requires a pH range of 6.5 to 8.5 S.U. at both Outfall 001 and Outfall
002 when the Facility is discharging, monitored weekly by grab samples. The pH limitations are
based on the State WQSs for Coastal and Marine Waters, Class SB at 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)3,
which require that the pH of the receiving water be in the range of 6.5 to 8.5 S.U. These
limitations are based on CWA § 301(b)(1)(C) and 40 CFR § 122.44(d).
5.2.2.4 Chemical Oxygen Demand
Oxygen is measured in its dissolved form as dissolved oxygen (DO). Indirect indicators
commonly used to measure the oxygen demand in wastewater include biological oxygen demand
(BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). BOD measures the amount of oxygen consumed
by microorganisms in decomposing organic matter in water. COD measures the chemical
oxidation of organic and inorganic matter (i.e., the extraction of dissolved oxygen from water via
chemical reaction). The rate of oxygen consumption in a waterbody is affected by several
variables: temperature, pH, the presence of microorganisms, and the type of organic and
inorganic materials. Oxygen demand directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen in rivers
and streams. The greater the oxygen demand (i.e., the higher the concentration of BOD and/or
COD), the more rapidly oxygen is depleted in the stream. Depletion of the in-stream oxygen
levels cause aquatic organisms to become stressed, suffocate, and die.
As described above, the Chelsea River is listed in the Massachusetts Year 2016 Integrated List of
Waters as not supporting for its designated uses and DO is listed as a cause. The Massachusetts
WQSs at 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)4 requires DO levels in Class SB waters designated for
shellfishing be no less than 5.0 mg/L. EPA does not currently have information regarding
dissolved oxygen in discharges from the Facility. However, the 2019 permit application provides
a sample result for both BOD and COD for Outfall 001. BOD was not detected in this sample.
COD was detected at a concentration of 25 mg/L. Therefore, COD is the appropriate indirect
indicator for DO at this Facility.

Therefore, the Draft Permit includes a monitoring requirement for COD for Outfall 001,
monitored monthly. This information is necessary to determine if discharges of COD from the
Facility cause, or have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above
State WQSs.
5.2.2.5 Oil and Grease
Oil and Grease is not a single chemical constituent, but includes a large range of organic
compounds, which can be both petroleum-related (e.g., hydrocarbons) and non-petroleum (e.g.,
vegetable and animal oils and greases, fats, and waxes). These compounds have varying
physical, chemical, and toxicological properties. Generally, oils and greases in surface waters
either float on the surface, are solubilized or emulsified in the water column, adsorb onto floating
or suspended solids and debris, or settle on the bottom or banks. Oil and grease, or certain
compounds within an oil and grease mixture, can be lethal to fish, benthic organisms and waterdwelling wildlife.
From December 1, 2014 through October 31, 2020, oil and grease levels reported for Outfall 001
have ranged from below laboratory minimum levels to 31 mg/L.
The 2014 Permit limit of 15 mg/L is based on the benchmark level from EPA’s guidance to, and
as a means of establishing a categorization within, the petroleum marketing terminals and oil
production-facilities categories. 20 Performance data from this Facility and other terminals in
Massachusetts support that this effluent limit can be achieved through the proper operation of a
correctly-sized OWS and properly implemented best management practices (BMPs). In addition,
a concentration of 15 mg/L is recognized as the level at which many oils produce a visible sheen
and/or cause an undesirable taste in fish.21 As described above, the designated uses aesthetics
primary and secondary contact and fish consumption designated use are not supported in Chelsea
River
Consistent with anti-backsliding requirements found in 40 CFR § 122.44(l), and to meet State
WQSs, given the impairments to Chelsea River, the Draft Permit maintains the maximum daily
limit of 15 mg/L for oil and grease at Outfall 001, monitored monthly.
Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons
TPH analysis measures the hydrocarbon fraction of oil and grease, consisting of compounds with
six carbon atoms (C6) to compounds with 25 carbon atoms (C25). The physical characteristics of
the various petroleum fractions determine their fate and transport in the environment. The more
soluble and volatile fractions are more likely to leach to groundwater, enter the air, or
biodegrade. The relatively low density of smaller petroleum fractions tend to float in water and
form thin surface films that affect aquatic organisms or other animals on the water’s surface. The
higher molecular weight compounds tend to sorb to sediment and persist at the site of release.

D.C. (July, 1974).

These petroleum fractions tend to accumulate in substrates, causing stresses for benthic
organisms, shellfish, or bottom-feeding fish. 22
TPH is regulated by the CWA as stated in Title 40 Section 112, which pertains to stormwater
discharge permitting. See also 40 CFR 122.26. Because petroleum products are complex
mixtures of hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds, sampling a range of hydrocarbon compounds
(e.g., TPH) and the most prevalent individual compounds (e.g., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
xylenes and Group I and II polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) serves as an indicator of relative
petroleum contamination. The use of TPH as an indicator parameter is a common approach
implemented by regulatory agencies in the United States to establish target cleanup levels for
contaminated soil or water.23
TPH was included in the 2014 Permit with a maximum daily limit of 5 mg/L at Outfall 002.
From December 1, 2014 through October 31, 2020, TPH ranged from below the laboratory
minimum levels to 2.2 µg/L at Outfall 002. Consistent with anti-backsliding requirements found
in 40 CFR §122.44(l), and to meet State WQSs, given the impairments to Chelsea River, the
Draft Permit maintains this limitation at Outfall 002.
5.2.2.6 Bacteria
While the Facility does not engage in activities that would be expected to generate large sources
of bacteria, stormwater runoff can readily transport bacteria from the waste products of warmblooded animals or pathogens, which attach to organic and inorganic particles. Fecal coliform, E.
coli, and enterococci bacteria, are indicators of contamination from sewage and/or the feces of
warm-blooded wildlife (mammals and birds). Bacteria can survive in freshwater and saltwater
environments and can impact water quality. As described above, the Chelsea River is a Class SB
water. Where designated, Class SB waters shall be suitable for shellfish harvesting with
depuration (Restricted and Conditionally Restricted Shellfish Areas). Waters with a shellfishing
designated use have fecal coliform as the indicator bacteria for recreational uses and for
shellfishing use. See 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)(4). The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries
(DMF) Shellfish Sanitation and Management classifies the shellfish area including Chelsea River
and the Mystic River (GBH4) as prohibited for shellfishing (closed to harvest of shellfish under
all conditions, except gathering of seeds for municipal propagation programs under a DMF
permit). 24
The 2014 Permit included monitoring requirements for fecal coliform as part of the pollutant
scan to determine if bacteria in stormwater discharges from the Facility could occur at
concentrations that could cause or contribute to an excursion above WQSs. From December 1,
2014 through April 30, 2021, fecal coliform was detected in most of the samples for Outfall 001,

with a median of 1585 colony forming units per 100 mL (cfu/100 mL) and a high of 9900
cfu/100 mL.
The Massachusetts WQSs at 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)(4)(a) limit fecal coliform in Class SB waters
designated for shellfishing. The Massachusetts water quality standards limit fecal coliform to a
geometric mean MPN (most probable number) of 88 organisms per 100 mL and not more than
10% of the samples exceeding an MPN of 260 organisms per 100 mL or other values of
equivalent protection based on sampling and analytical methods used by the Massachusetts
Division of Marine Fisheries and approved by the National Shellfish Sanitation Program in the
latest revision of the Guide For The Control of Molluscan Shellfish (more stringent regulations
may apply, see 314 CMR 4.06(1)(d)(5)). Monitoring over the past permit term demonstrates that
the Facility has the potential to discharge levels of bacteria in excess of water quality standards.
The Massachusetts Year 2016 Integrated List of Waters indicates that Chelsea River is impaired
for shellfishing and listed fecal coliform as a pollutant requiring a TMDL. However, shellfishing
is currently prohibited in Chelsea River by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
MassDEP released the Final Pathogen TMDL for the Boston Harbor, Weymouth-Weir, and
Mystic Watersheds in October 2018. 25 The TMDL contains specific water quality targets for
pathogens in the Mystic River sub-basin, including the Chelsea River (MA71-06). According to
the TMDL, bacteria problems persist over much of the area due to a combination of point and
non-point source pollution, including wastewater treatment plant effluent, piped discharges of
stormwater from Phase I and Phase II communities, and discharges from CSOs. Most of the
bacteria sources are believed to be stormwater related. The TMDL identifies the Chelsea River
(MA71-06, SB/CSO) as a high priority with wet and dry weather bacteria issues as indicated by
fecal coliform sampling. High priority segments are indicative of the potential presence of raw
sewage and pose a greater risk to the public. CSOs, such as those in Chelsea River, have
historically been a significant contributor to bacteria pollution. As aggressive efforts to control
CSO discharges reduce bacteria loads from these sources, stormwater discharges will be a
dominant source of bacteria pollution along with non-point sources. Fecal coliform samples
collected under the 2014 Permit contain relatively high pathogen counts. Given the pathogen
levels in the effluent and the requirements of the TMDL, the Draft Permit establishes fecal
coliform effluent limitations of 88 organisms per 100 mL and not more than 10% of the samples
exceeding an MPN of 260 organisms per 100 mL for Outfall 001.
At the same time, Massachusetts WQSs use Enterococcus as the preferred indicator for
recreational designated uses. See 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)(4)(b). The Boston Harbor Final Pathogen
TMDL also specifies enterococci as the indicator bacteria for Chelsea River (Class SB(CSO)).
Therefore, the Draft Permit establishes monitoring requirements for Enterococcus consistent
with the TMDL and State WQSs. The Draft Permit specifies monthly monitoring to provide data
necessary to further evaluate pathogen issues in Chelsea River. After one year, if all monitoring
results are below the applicable WQS, the monitoring frequency may be reduced to once per
year, in conjunction with the annual monitoring event.

5.2.2.7 Temperature
Section 502(6) of the Clean Water Act defines heat as a “pollutant.” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(6).
Therefore, thermal effluent, such as boiler blowdown, is considered a pollutant, and such
discharges require a NPDES permit. As described above, the Facility discharges a small volume
of boiler blowdown and steam condensate, necessitated by the storage of No. 6 fuel oil, the
viscosity of which can be affected by ambient temperatures. The boiler blowdown and steam
condensate enters the stormwater conveyance system, comingles with stormwater and
groundwater remediation effluent, and receives treatment through the oil/water separator prior to
entering the Chelsea River. Based on the proportion of boiler blowdown relative to the total
volume of effluent, the configuration of the stormwater conveyance system and expected
retention times, the temperature noted for the effluent in the permittee’s NPDES permit renewal
application, and ambient temperature data collected by the Massachusetts Water Resources
Authority, 26 EPA determined no measurable thermal effluent is discharged to the Chelsea River
from this facility.
EPA evaluated temperature during the summer when a heated discharge would be of most
concern. During the issuance of the 2014 Permit, EPA requested additional temperature
monitoring data and information regarding the generation of boiler blowdown from the Facility.
The boiler blowdown is generated as a liquid condensate and to some extent, steam. Boiler
blowdown is generated by boiler number 1 at a rate and typical total of 25 gallons per day. Boiler
blowdown is generated by boiler number 2 at a rate and typical total of 30 gallons per day. The
maximum daily volume if boiler blowdown is discharged from both boilers is typically 55
gallons up to a reported maximum of 200 gallons per day. The operating temperature of the
boilers ranges from 100 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which is equivalent to the maximum possible
temperature of boiler blowdown. The temperature of the boiler blowdown effluent upon mixing
at the point it enters the stormwater conveyance system was recorded at 84 and 92 degrees
Fahrenheit in July 2014. The temperature of the stormwater and groundwater remediation
effluent prior to comingling with boiler blowdown was recorded at 73.3 degrees Fahrenheit. The
storage capacity of the oil/water separator is 10,000 gallons. The temperature of the comingled
effluents in the oil/water separator was recorded at 74.4 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature
neither exceeds the applicable water quality criterion for temperature of a Class SB waterbody,
85 degrees Fahrenheit, nor does this temperature demonstrate a change in temperature of more
than 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (applicable July through September) even before mixing with
ambient water.
To evaluate any potential thermal impact to the Chelsea River that would exceed applicable
water quality criteria, EPA also considered ambient conditions during issuance of the 2014
Permit. As described above, between 2008 through 2018, temperature in Chelsea River has
ranged from 1.5°C to 24.7°C (76.46oF). The Chelsea River holds an average 269,243,682 cubic
feet of water.27 Even if EPA overestimates the thermal impact by calculating an instream

temperature using only the upstream critical low flow contribution to Chelsea River, 0.055
million gallons per day, 28 at the maximum temperature of the Chelsea River, 24.7°C, 10,000
gallons of effluent discharged at 76.46oF does not exceed 85 degrees Fahrenheit and will not
raise the temperature of the Chelsea River 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit or more. 29 Furthermore, even
the direct discharge of 200 gallons per day of boiler blowdown at the maximum 170 degrees
Fahrenheit, which is technically not possible given the facility configuration, does not exceed 85
degrees Fahrenheit and will not raise the temperature of the Chelsea River 1.5 degrees
Fahrenheit or more.30 Therefore, EPA maintains that no thermal limits are necessary to meet
Massachusetts’ WQSs for temperature for a Class SB waterbody. However, to ensure that
thermal discharges meet the assumptions of EPA’s analysis, the Draft Permit includes
temperature monitoring requirements. EPA will use these data to evaluate compliance with State
WQSs for temperature.
5.2.3 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
5.2.3.1 Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl benzene, and Xylenes
Refined petroleum products contain numerous types of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
Effluent limitations for the VOCs present in refined petroleum products are typically established
for the compounds most difficult to remove from the environment and that demonstrate the
greatest degree of toxicity. VOCs partition to environmental media based on physical and
chemical properties, including solubility and vapor pressure. Generally, the higher the solubility
of a VOC in water, the more difficult it is to remove. Relative to other VOCs, the VOCs
benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the three xylene compounds (i.e., total xylenes) –
collectively known as BTEX – exhibit high solubility, are more toxic, are more difficult to treat,
and are found at high concentrations in gasoline and light distillates such as diesel fuel. BTEX
concentrations generally decrease in heavier grades of petroleum distillate products such as fuel
oils. 31
In developing the 2014 Permit, benzene was selected as the indicator parameter for the volatile
petroleum-related organic compounds at Outfall 001. Benzene was selected because this
compound has the highest solubility, is one of the most toxic petroleum constituents, is found at
relatively high concentrations in light distillate products and a recommended water quality
criterion has been published. The concentration of benzene in gasoline is approximately 20,000
parts per million.32 The concentration in diesel fuel, although several orders of magnitude

The mixing equation is as follows: downstream concentration = (effluent flow*effluent temperature + ambient

smaller than that found in gasoline, is still environmentally significant. The average percent by
weight of benzene in diesel fuel is approximately 0.03 percent which is equivalent to a
concentration of benzene of approximately 300 parts per million. The State WQSs contain
minimum criteria applicable to all surface waters for toxic pollutants and require the use of
EPA’s National Recommended Water Quality Criteria: 2002, EPA 822-R-02-047, November
2002 where a specific pollutant is not otherwise listed in 314 CMR 4.00. See 314 CMR
4.05(5)(e).
As a result, the 2005 Permit established a WQBEL of 51 µg/L for benzene at Outfall 001. The
2014 Permit maintained this benzene WQBEL and required monthly monitoring. The 2014
Permit also required monthly monitoring, without limits, for the daily maximum concentration.
In addition, quarterly monitoring for benzene toluene, ethyl benzene, and the three xylene
compounds at Outfall 001 and in the Chelsea River was required to ensure that selection of
benzene as an indicator parameter was sufficiently stringent to meet State WQSs. This
monitoring requirement was automatically reduced to annually after three years.
The Final Massachusetts Year 2016 Integrated List of Waters lists Chelsea River as impaired for
petroleum hydrocarbons. The bulk petroleum storage facilities that discharge to the Chelsea
River are explicitly noted as one of the sources of these pollutants. From December 1, 2014
through April 30, 2020, benzene was not detected in any sample for Outfall 001. Further, all
samples for toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene were non-detect at Outfall 001. Since monitoring
results indicate that the concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene compounds do not
exceed applicable criteria, EPA has determined that the use of benzene as an indicator parameter
and the effluent limitation imposed meets State WQSs.
In 2015, EPA updated human health criteria for benzene using both noncarcinogenic and
carcinogenic toxicity endpoints. The updated human health criteria for noncarcinogenic effects
for benzene are 90 µg/L for consumption of organisms only. The updated human health for
carcinogenic effects (at a 10-6 cancer risk level) for benzene are 16 µg/L using the lower cancer
slope factor and 58 µg/L using the upper cancer slope factor for consumption of organisms only.
EPA recommended the lower criterion, based on the carcinogenic effects of benzene, as the
updated human health criterion. These updated criteria replaced EPA’s previously published
values (i.e., 2002). The State issued proposed revised surface WQSs for public notice and
comment from October 4, 2019, through November 8, 2019, that would adopt EPA’s
recommended criteria. The revised surface WQSs have not been finalized, however. If the
proposed benzene criterion, 16 µg/L, is finalized prior to issuance of the Final Permit, EPA will
consider the applicability of the 16 µg/L criterion to discharges from this Facility when
establishing the appropriate effluent limitation.
Further, EPA is required to apply the more stringent of applicable water quality-based effluent
limits and technology-based limits. In 2017, EPA issued a revised benzene limitation in EPA’s
RGP of 5 µg/L. In establishing this revised limitation, EPA considered the presence of benzene
at contaminated or formerly contaminated sites. EPA identified benzene as a pollutant based on:
1) the type of activity taking place, which includes dewatering, remediation and/or hydrostatic
testing; and 2) available data showing the presence of benzene in discharges of contaminated
groundwater and certain surface waters, which may include stormwater, surface water and

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 31 of 106

potable water. EPA then considered the types of treatment typically used for dewatering,
remediation and/or hydrostatic testing. Treatment types considered in the RGP, which are
required at RGP sites if necessary to meet effluent limitations, include: 1) adsorption/absorption;
2) advanced oxidation processes; 3) air stripping; 4) granulated activated carbon/liquid phase
carbon adsorption; 5) ion exchange; 6) precipitation/coagulation/flocculation; and 7)
separation/filtration. Free product recovery, air stripping, 33 mechanical pre-treatment, flow
equalization, oil/water separation, membrane, and adsorptive media 34 remove benzene.
In reviewing the applicability of a 5 µg/L technology-based limitation for benzene to this
Facility, EPA finds that discharges from bulk stations and terminals are consistent with the type
of discharges considered under the RGP, which include hydrostatic testing discharges from
dewatering of pipelines, tanks, and similar structures and appurtenances that store or convey
petroleum products, and dewatering and/or remediation discharges from collection structures
(e.g., dikes) utilized for collecting miscellaneous sources of water from contaminated or formerly
contaminated sites or sources, including when contamination is a result of the infiltration of
contaminated groundwater or stormwater. Further, conditions at the Facility are consistent with
those under which this limitation can be achieved. Specifically, the combination of best
management practices and treatment are used at the Facility. Finally, EPA finds that a benzene
concentration of 5 µg/L is consistent with monitoring results from this and other facilities in
Region 1 with similar activities and discharges. Specifically, the concentrations of benzene
reported by other bulk petroleum storage facilities that discharge to coastal waters within the
Boston Harbor Drainage Area from December 1, 2014 through October 31, 2020 are
summarized in Table 2, below.

** This outfall has been eliminated and was limited to 5 µg/L for benzene.
*** The reporting period is July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2020. Reporting periods differ
for these facilities due to differences in when draft permits were developed.
Relative to the monitoring data from December 1, 2014 through October 31, 2020, the Facility
reported a benzene concentration less than 5 µg/L 100 percent of the time (in 57 of 57 samples).
Therefore, based on available information, EPA has determined that discharges containing
benzene at this Facility can achieve a limitation of 5 µg/L using existing controls. See 40 CFR
§ 125.3(d). The Draft Permit proposes a daily maximum technology-based effluent limitation for
benzene of 5 µg/L for Outfall 001 on a case-by-case basis using best professional judgement,
consistent with requirements found in CWA § 402(a)(1)(B). The Draft Permit requires monthly
monitoring. The Draft Permit also maintains the annual monitoring requirements for toluene,
ethylbenzene and xylenes in the discharge and all BTEX compounds in the receiving water, as
well as the reopener clause, in accordance with 40 CFR § 122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C).
The 2005 Permit also established a limitation for benzene at 5 µg/L and for total BTEX at 100
µg/L for Outfall 002 on a case-by-case basis using BPJ. These TBELs were maintained in the
2014 Permit. During the monitoring period, these parameters were detected once, with benzene
detected at 48.2 µg/L and total BTEX at 156.1 µg/L. Consistent with anti-backsliding
requirements found in 40 CFR §122.44(l), and to meet State WQSs, given the impairments to
Chelsea River, the Draft Permit maintains the maximum daily limit for benzene and total BTEX
compounds at Outfall 002.
The Permittee requested that monitoring for these parameters be eliminated or reduced to once
per year consistent with EPA’s RGP for groundwater remediation discharges. Consistent with
Part 5.1.2 of EPA’s RGP, request for reduction in monitoring requirements, the discharge “must
be in compliance with the effluent limitation for any parameter for which a reduction is
requested.” Given that both benzene and total BTEX exceeded the permit limits, EPA has not
provided a monitoring frequency reduction. The Draft Permit maintains monthly monitoring for
both parameters at Outfall 002.
5.2.4 Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds (SVOCs)
5.2.4.1 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 33 of 106

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of semi-volatile organic compounds
(SVOCs) that form through the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons and are present in
petroleum derivatives and residuals. Discharge of these materials can introduce PAHs into
surface water where they may volatilize, photolyze, oxidize, biodegrade, bind to suspended
particles or sediments, or accumulate in aquatic organisms. 35 In soils, PAHs may also undergo
degradation, accumulation in plants, or transport via groundwater. In an estuarine environment,
volatilization and adsorption to suspended sediments with subsequent deposition are the primary
removal processes for medium and high molecular weight PAHs. Several PAHs are well known
animal carcinogens, while others can enhance the response of the carcinogenic PAHs.
There are 16 PAH compounds identified as priority pollutants under the CWA. See Appendix A
to 40 CFR Part 423. Group I PAHs are comprised of seven known animal carcinogens. They are:
benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene,
dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene. Group II PAHs are comprised of nine
priority pollutant PAHs which are not considered carcinogens, but which can enhance or inhibit
the response of the carcinogenic PAHs. They are: acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene,
benzo(g,h,i)perylene, fluoranthene, fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene.
In developing the 2014 Permit, one Group I PAH, benzo(a)pyrene, and one Group II PAH,
naphthalene, were selected as the indicator parameters for semi-volatile petroleum-related
organic compounds at Outfall 001. While the distillation process removes a greater proportion of
Group I PAHs by weight, these compounds can still be present in low concentrations,
particularly benzo(a)pyrene. Benzo(a)pyrene has been used extensively as a model carcinogen
and as a positive control in a variety of risk assessment tests. EPA has designated this compound
as a known animal carcinogen and probable human carcinogen. Relative to the other Group I
PAHs, it is strongly carcinogenic. Of Group II PAHs, naphthalene, like benzo(a)pyrene poses
high calculable risk relative to other PAHs. It is included as a priority pollutant under the CWA
and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. In middle and heavy distillates, naphthalene is
one of the most commonly found compounds, present in diesel fuel at up to approximately 0.8
and 0.4 percent by weight, respectively. 36 Naphthalene is only slightly soluble in water, but is
highly soluble in benzene and other solvents.
The 2014 Permit included a monthly average effluent limit of 0.018 μg/L for benzo(a)pyrene
monitored monthly, and monthly monitoring, without limits, for the daily maximum
concentration. The 2014 Permit also included a daily maximum effluent limit of 100 µg/L for
naphthalene at Outfall 001. Finally, quarterly monitoring for benzo(a)anthracene,
benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene,

Group I PAHs
Group I PAH compounds are listed as priority pollutants in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 423.
Concentrations of each of the Group I PAH compounds exceed applicable criteria; therefore,
EPA has determined that discharges of these priority pollutants cause or have a reasonable
potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above WQSs. This determination is based on the
monitoring data collected during the permit term, as well as the Chelsea River impairments for
the Aquatic Life, Aesthetics, Primary Contact and Secondary Contact Uses due to the presence
of petroleum hydrocarbons. Further, the bulk petroleum storage facilities that discharge to the
Chelsea River, including the Facility, are explicitly noted as one of the sources of these
pollutants. Therefore, effluent limitations are required.
The Draft Permit proposes an effluent limitation for benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene,
benzo(b)fluoroanthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, and
indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene of 0.018 µg/L, monitored monthly. This effluent limitation is based on

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 35 of 106

the “organism only” human health WQC for each individual compound, selected because the
uses designated for Chelsea River includes fishing (i.e., consumption of organisms). The Draft
Permit also requires annual monitoring for Group I PAHs in the receiving water to ensure these
limitations are sufficiently stringent to meet WQSs.
Where effluent limits have been established in NPDES permits but compliance cannot be
determined using currently approved analytical methods (e.g. if WQBELs are less than the
analytical capability of the methods), EPA must establish a compliance level. The National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES): Use of Sufficiently Sensitive Test Methods for
Permit Applications and Reporting Rule37 requires the use of an EPA-approved method that is
sufficiently sensitive. Therefore, the Draft Permit requires that the quantitative methodology
used for PAH analysis must achieve the ML of ≤0.1 µg/L for each Group I PAH compound and
this ML is the compliance level for each Group I PAH compound. This ML is based on the
method that has the lowest ML of the analytical methods approved under 40 CFR Part 136,38 and
is consistent with EPA’s TSD, page 111, which recommends, “the compliance level be defined
in the permit as the minimum level (ML).
Group II PAHs
Group II PAH compounds are listed as priority pollutants in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 423.
Although several Group II PAH compounds were detected, since monitoring results indicate that
the concentrations of individual Group II PAHs do not exceed applicable criteria (i.e.,
acenaphthene human health organism-only criteria of 990 µg/L, anthracene human health
organism-only criteria of 40,000 µg/L, fluoranthene human health organism-only criteria of 140
µg/L, fluorene human health organism-only criteria of 5,300 µg/L and pyrene human health
organism-only criteria of 4,000 µg/L), EPA has determined that discharges of these priority
pollutants do not cause, or have a reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion
above WQSs and WQBELs for additional Group II PAHs are not required. However, EPA is
required to apply the more stringent of applicable water quality-based effluent limits and
technology-based limits. See CWA § 301(b)(1)(C) and 40 CFR §§ 122.44(d)(1),122.44(d)(5),
125.84(e) and 125.94(i). In 2017, EPA reissued a naphthalene limitation in EPA’s RGP of 20
µg/L. In establishing this limitation, EPA considered the presence of napthalene in discharges
from contaminated or formerly contaminated sites. EPA identified napthalene as a pollutant
based on: 1) the type of activity taking place, which includes dewatering, remediation and/or
hydrostatic testing; and 2) available data showing the presence of napthalene in discharges of
contaminated groundwater and certain surface waters, which may include stormwater, surface
water and potable water. EPA then considered the types of treatment typically used for
dewatering, remediation and/or hydrostatic testing. Treatment types considered in the RGP,
which are required at RGP sites if necessary to meet effluent limitations, include: 1)
adsorption/absorption; 2) advanced oxidation processes; 3) air stripping; 4) granulated activated
carbon/liquid phase carbon adsorption; 5) ion exchange; 6)
precipitation/coagulation/flocculation; and 7) separation/filtration. Granular activated carbon and

air stripping39 are appropriate treatment technologies for naphthalene, and flow equalization,
oil/water separation, aeration and membrane 40 remove napthalene.
In reviewing the applicability of a 20 µg/L technology-based limitation for naphthalene to this
Facility, EPA finds that discharges from bulk stations and terminals are consistent with the type
of discharges considered under the RGP, which include hydrostatic testing discharges from
dewatering of pipelines, tanks, and similar structures and appurtenances that store or convey
petroleum products, and dewatering and/or remediation discharges from collection structures
(e.g., dikes) utilized for collecting miscellaneous sources of water from contaminated or formerly
contaminated sites or sources, including when contamination is a result of the infiltration of
contaminated groundwater or stormwater. Further, conditions at the Facility are consistent with
those under which this limitation can be achieved, specifically, the combination of applicable
best management practices and treatment are used at the Facility. Finally, EPA finds that a
naphthalene concentration of 20 µg/L is consistent with monitoring results from this and other
facilities in Region 1 with similar activities and discharges. Specifically, the concentrations of
naphthalene reported by the bulk petroleum storage facilities that discharge directly to Chelsea
River and Sales Creek from December 1, 2014 through October 31, 2020 are summarized in
Table 4, below.

----Note: *This outfall is already limited to 10 or 20 ug/L for naphthalene.
** This outfall has been eliminated and was limited to 20 µg/L for naphthalene.
*** The reporting period is July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2020. Reporting periods differ
for these facilities due to differences in when draft permits were developed.
Relative to the monitoring data from December 1, 2014 through October 31, 2020, the Facility
reported a naphthalene concentration less than 20 µg/L 100 percent of the time (in 57 of 57
samples). Therefore, based on available information, EPA has determined that discharges
containing naphthalene at this Facility can achieve a limitation of 20 µg/L using existing
controls. See 40 CFR § 125.3(d). Therefore, the Draft Permit proposes a daily maximum effluent
limitation of 20 µg/L for naphthalene, monitored monthly at outfall 001. The Draft Permit also
requires annual monitoring for acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene,
fluoranthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene (additional Group II PAHs) to ensure these
compounds continue to meet the applicable criteria.
The Permittee has requested relaxation of monitoring requirements for PAHs. Given the
impairments to the Chelsea River and petroleum hydrocarbons having been identified as a
pollutant contributing to these impairments, the proposed effluent limitations and continued
monitoring requirements are necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of the CWA
and ensure compliance with State WQSs. See CWA §§ 308(a), 402(a)(1) and (2), 33 U.S.C.
§§ 1318(a), 1342(a)(1) and (2).
5.2.5 Chemicals and Additives
5.2.5.1 Total Residual Chlorine
Chlorine and chlorine compounds are toxic to aquatic life. Free chlorine is directly toxic to
aquatic organisms and can react with naturally occurring organic compounds in receiving waters
to form toxic compounds such as trihalomethane. The Facility uses potable water for hydrostatic
test water and washdown water. Potable water sources are typically chlorinated to minimize or
eliminate pathogens. 40 CFR § 141.72 stipulates that a public water system’s residual
disinfectant concentration in the water entering the distribution system cannot be less than 0.2
mg/L for more than four hours. The 2014 Permit included monitoring requirements for total
residual chlorine (TRC) in conjunction with Whole Effluent Toxicity testing at Outfall 001.
From December 1, 2014 through October 31, 2020, (Appendix A), TRC was detected in two
samples at concentrations of 36 µg/L and 38 µg/L.
The Massachusetts Water Quality Standards Implementation Policy for the Control of Toxic
Pollutants in Surface Waters (February 23, 1990) specifies that “Waters shall be protected from
unnecessary discharges of excess chlorine.” State WQSs further require the use of federal water
quality criteria where a specific pollutant could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
existing or designated uses. See 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e). Because the discharge of stormwater
occurs intermittently, EPA considered the acute criterion. EPA’s National Recommended Water
Quality Criteria for aquatic life in saltwater for TRC is as follows:

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 38 of 106

13 µg/L (0.013 mg/L) acute criterion
Given that the dilution factor for the Chelsea River is zero (i.e., 1:1), the TRC maximum daily
effluent limitation is equivalent to the acute criterion as follows:
Acute TRC limit = 13 µg/L
Since the concentrations of TRC detected in the discharges from Outfall 001 occasionally exceed
this criterion, the discharge of effluent has a reasonable potential to cause or contribute to
excursions of the acute criterion for TRC (Appendix C). The Draft Permit proposes a daily
maximum TRC effluent limitation of 13 µg/L, monitored monthly. The proposed effluent
limitation and continued monitoring requirements are necessary and appropriate to carry out the
provisions of the CWA and ensure compliance with State WQSs. See CWA §308(a), 33 U.S.C.
§1318(a); 40 CFR §§ 122.4(d), 122.44(d)(1). Because the minimum level of detection for TRC is
above the criterion, and similar to the approach discussed above for PAHs, EPA has set a
compliance level of 30 µg/L. 41 This ML is based on the method that has the lowest method
detection limit of the analytical methods approved under 40 CFR Part 136, and is calculated in
accordance with 40 CFR Part 136.
5.2.5.2 Phthalates
Phthalates are a widely used group of compounds that contain a phenyl ring with two attached
acetate groups, often referred to as plasticizers. Because phthalates are not a part of the polymers
that make up plastics, they can be released from these materials fairly easily. The use of plastics
and materials containing plasticizers is widespread. Total phthalates is the sum of: diethylhexyl
phthalate (DEHP), benzyl butyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dimethyl
phthalate and di-n-octyl phthalate. These six phthalates are listed as a priority pollutant in
Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 423. DEHP, also known as bis (2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate, is a
plasticizer most widely used in the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), but is also used
in boilers and/or cooling towers. It is one of the more toxic phthalate compounds and is listed as
a class B2 probable carcinogen.
The 2014 Permit included monitoring for phthalates because the Facility discharges boiler
blowdown and to ensure these compounds are not present in discharges from the Facility at
concentrations that cause, have a reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion
above State WQSs. Because the receiving water is not a public water supply, EPA considers the
human health organism-only criteria. The human health organism-only EPA National
Recommended Water Quality Criteria for phthalates are as follows:
Butylbenzyl Phthalate:
0.10 µg/L
Diethyl Phthalate:
41

Standard Method 4500-Cl E, low-level amperometric direct method (low-level amperometric titration method).

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

600 µg/L
Dimethyl Phthalate:
2000 µg/L
Di-n-Butyl Phthalate:
30 µg/L
Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate:
0.37 µg/L
From December 1, 2014, through April 30, 2020, phthalates were detected on two occasion:
0.676 µg/L in December 2017 and 7.759 ug/L in April 2018. EPA notes that data entry errors
were identified for phthalates. Data that could not be validated have been excluded. Since the
concentration of phthalates measures is below applicable criteria, the Draft Permit does not
include limitations for phthalates. However, because the Facility has detected phthalates in the
effluent at a level that is above the revised human health organism-only criteria for one or more
phthalate compounds, and given the data validation encountered, the Draft Permit includes a
quarterly monitoring requirement for phthalates.
5.2.5.3 Phenol
Phenol and phenolic compounds are widely used chemical intermediates and occur in the
environment as a result of manufacturing, use of products containing phenols, from combustion
sources, coal gas, and natural decay of organic matter. Phenol can also be present at low
concentrations in gasoline, diesel and kerosene. Phenol and a number of other compounds
including nitro-phenols and chlorinated phenols are listed as priority pollutants in Appendix A to
40 CFR Part 423. Further, phenol and other phenolic compounds are included in EPA’s National
Recommended Water Quality Criteria as having organoleptic (i.e., taste and odor) effects in
water at low levels. The threshold at which phenol has an effect on taste and odor in water is 300
µg/L.
The 2014 Permit included a quarterly monitoring requirement for phenol in the pollutant scan to
ensure it is not present in quantities that could cause or contribute to an excursion above WQSs.
This monitoring requirement automatically reduced to annually after three years. From
December 1, 2014 through April 30, 2020, phenol was not detected above laboratory minimum
levels at Outfall 001. As a result, the Draft Permit does not include monitoring for this
parameter.
5.2.6 Metals
Metals are naturally occurring constituents in the environment and generally vary in
concentration according to local geology. Metals are neither created nor destroyed by biological
or chemical processes. However, metals can be transformed through processes including
adsorption, precipitation, co-precipitation, and complexation. Some metals are essential nutrients
at low levels for humans, animals, plants and microorganisms, but toxic at higher levels (e.g.,

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 40 of 106

copper and zinc). Other metals have no known biological function (e.g., lead). The
environmental chemistry of metals strongly influences their fate and transport in the environment
and their effects on human and ecological receptors. Toxicity results when metals are
biologically available at concentrations affecting the survival, reproduction and behavior of an
organism.
The Permittee has obtained monitoring data for total recoverable cadmium, copper, lead, nickel
and zinc in the discharge and the receiving water in conjunction with Whole Effluent Toxicity
testing, total recoverable chromium and iron in the discharge in conjunction with pollutant scan
requirements, and total recoverable lead as a separate monitoring requirement. From December
1, 2014 through April 30, 2020 (Appendix A) for Outfall 001, total recoverable cadmium,
copper, lead nickel, zinc, chromium and iron were detected in the discharge and total recoverable
copper, lead, nickel, and zinc were detected in the receiving water. EPA completed an analysis to
determine if these discharges cause, or have a reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an
excursion above State WQSs using EPA’s 2002 National Recommended Water Quality Criteria
for metals (Appendix C). State WQSs contain minimum criteria applicable to all surface waters
for toxic pollutants, which requires the use of EPA’s National Recommended Water Quality
Criteria: 2002, EPA 822-R-02-047, November 2002 where a specific pollutant is not otherwise
listed in 314 CMR 4.00. See 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e). Because the discharge occurs intermittently,
EPA considered the acute saltwater aquatic life criteria, and because the receiving water is not a
public water supply, EPA considered the human health organism-only criteria. The acute
saltwater aquatic life and human health organism-only EPA National Recommended Water
Quality Criteria for metals, expressed in terms of the dissolved metal in the water column, are as
follows:
Copper:
Saltwater acute (Class SB) = 4.8 µg/L
Lead:
Saltwater acute (Class SB) = 210 µg/L
Nickel:
Saltwater acute (Class SB) = 74 µg/L
Organism-only = 4,600 µg/L
Zinc:
Saltwater acute (Class SB) = 90 µg/L
Organism-only = 26,000 µg/L
Chromium: (chromium 6+ shown)
Saltwater acute (Class SB) = 1,100 µg/L
Given the impairment in the Chelsea River for odor, EPA also considered criteria for metals
listed in EPA’s National Recommended Water Quality Criteria that cause an organoleptic effect
(i.e., taste and odor). The organoleptic effect EPA National Recommended Water Quality
Criteria for metals are as follows:

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 41 of 106

Copper:
1,000 µg/L
Zinc:
5,000 µg/L
The results of EPA’s analysis (Appendix C) indicate discharges of cadmium, lead, nickel, and
chromium do not cause, or have a reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion
above WQSs. As a result, the Draft Permit does not include effluent limitations for these metals.
Monitoring for total recoverable cadmium, lead, nickel, and zinc in the discharge and the
receiving water continue to be required in conjunction with Whole Effluent Toxicity testing,
discussed further below. The monitoring requirement for total recoverable chromium, which is
not required in the saltwater Whole Effluent Toxicity testing protocol, has been eliminated.
However, the results of EPA’s analysis (Appendix C) indicate discharges of copper and zinc
cause, or have a reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above the acute
aquatic life water quality criterion. Because regulations at 40 CFR § 122.45(c) require, with
limited exceptions, that effluent limits for metals in NPDES permits be expressed as total
recoverable metals, effluent limitations are expressed as total recoverable metals. 42 As a result,
the Draft Permit includes a daily maximum effluent limitation of 5.8 µg/L for total recoverable
copper and a daily maximum effluent limitation of 95.1 µg/L for total recoverable zinc, both
monitored monthly. In addition, monitoring for total recoverable copper and zinc in the
discharge and the receiving water continue to be required in conjunction with Whole Effluent
Toxicity Testing, discussed further below.
Finally, while iron is a non-priority pollutant under the CWA, EPA considered the following
water quality criterion for the protection of domestic water supplies. 43 This criterion was
established for aesthetic, rather than toxicological significance, specifically to prevent
objectionable tastes or laundry staining. This criterion has been published by EPA as an
organoleptic effect National Recommended Water Quality Criteria for iron.
Iron:
300 µg/L
The results of EPA’s analysis (Appendix C) indicate discharges of iron cause, or have a
reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above the organoleptic effect
criterion. As a result, the Draft Permit includes an effluent limitation of 300 µg/L for daily
maximum total recoverable iron, monitored monthly.

Cyanide is an inorganic pollutant often limited in conjunction with metals, because it readily
forms complexes with transition metals, particularly iron. Cyanide occurs in water in many
forms, including hydrogen cyanide (HCN), the cyanide ion (CN-), simple cyanides,
metallocyanide complexes, and as organic compounds. The relative concentrations of these
forms depend mainly on pH and temperature. Both HCN and CN- are toxic to aquatic life. The
cyanide ion readily converts to hydrogen cyanide at pH values less than 7.0. As a result, when
present in surface water, cyanide occurs more commonly as the more toxic hydrogen cyanide.
Certain bacteria, fungi, and algae can also produce cyanide, and cyanide is found naturally in
several species of plants. 44
The 2014 Permit included a monitoring requirement for cyanide at Outfall 001 as part of the
pollutant scan requirements given concentrations historically measured in groundwater. From
December 1, 2014 through April 30, 2020 (Appendix A) for Outfall 001, cyanide was detected
above laboratory minimum levels in 2 samples, ranging from 7.62 µg/L and 23 µg/L. EPA
completed an analysis to determine if these discharges cause, or have a reasonable potential to
cause, or contribute to an excursion above State WQSs using EPA’s 2002 National
Recommended Water Quality Criteria for metals (Appendix C). State WQSs contain minimum
criteria applicable to all surface waters for toxic pollutants, which requires the use of EPA’s
National Recommended Water Quality Criteria: 2002, EPA 822-R-02-047, November 2002
where a specific pollutant is not otherwise listed in 314 CMR 4.00. See 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e).
Because the discharge occurs intermittently, EPA considered the acute saltwater aquatic life
criteria, and because the receiving water is not a public water supply, EPA considered the human
health organism-only criteria. The acute saltwater aquatic life and human health organism-only
EPA National Recommended Water Quality Criteria for cyanide, expressed as free cyanide, are
as follows:
Cyanide:
Saltwater acute (Class SB) = 1 µg/L
Organism-only = 220,000 µg/L
The results of EPA’s analysis (Appendix C) indicate discharges of cyanide cause, have a
reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above the acute aquatic life water
quality criteria. As a result, the Draft Permit includes a daily maximum effluent limitation of 1
µg/L for cyanide, monitored monthly. This effluent limitation is expressed as free cyanide. The
proposed effluent limitation and continued monitoring requirements are necessary and
appropriate to carry out the provisions of the CWA and ensure compliance with State WQSs. See
CWA §308(a), 33 U.S.C. §1318(a); 40 CFR §§ 122.4(d), 122.44(d)(1).
Because the minimum level of detection for free cyanide is above the criterion, and similar to the
approach discussed above for PAHs and TRC, EPA has set a compliance level of 2 µg/L. 45 This
value is based on the method with the lowest published minimum level of the analytical methods
approved under 40 CFR Part 136.

5.2.8 Ammonia
Ammonia (NH3) is the un-ionized form of ammonia nitrogen. Elevated levels of ammonia can be
toxic to aquatic life. Temperature and pH affect the toxicity of ammonia to aquatic life. The
toxicity of ammonia increases as temperature increases and ammonia concentration and toxicity
increase as pH increases. Ammonia can affect fish growth, gill condition, organ weights and
hematocrit, and can result in excessive plant and algal growth, which can cause eutrophication.
Ammonia can also affect dissolved oxygen through nitrification, in which oxygen is consumed
as ammonia is oxidized. Low oxygen levels can then, in turn, increase ammonia by inhibiting
nitrification. Total ammonia-nitrogen concentrations in surface waters tends to be lower during
summer than during winter due to uptake by plants and decreased ammonia solubility at higher
temperatures.
As described above, the Chelsea River is impaired and requires a TMDL for ammonia (unionized). EPA’s recommended criteria for ammonia in saltwater are based on temperature, pH
and salinity in the receiving water. Higher temperatures and higher (more basic) pH values are of
greater environmental concern because these conditions result in higher concentrations of the
more toxic neutral form of ammonia (NH3) rather than the ammonium ion (NH4+). Based on
receiving water sampling from December 1, 2014 through September 30, 2020 , the surface
water pH in Chelsea River ranged from 6.95 to 7.95 S.U. and the salinity ranged from 0.0151 to
40.5 grams per kilogram (g/kg) (or parts per thousand (ppt)). Water quality data from the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority’s (MWRA) monitoring program for sampling location
027, located near the Facility on Chelsea River 46 indicates that the surface water temperature in
the Chelsea River from June to October during the years 2008 through 2018 ranged from 1.5°C
to 24.7°C. The salinity at MWRA sampling location 027 ranged from 7 to 33 ppt with a median
value of 30 ppt. EPA determined applicable criteria for ammonia representative of the worst-case
scenario using values for pH set at 8.5 SU, which is the maximum allowable water quality
standard for Class SB waters, a median salinity of 30 ppt, and maximum and minimum
temperature of 24.7°C and 1.5°C, respectively, representative of warm and cold water conditions.
Stormwater discharges from the Facility are intermittent. Therefore, EPA has assessed the
potential for discharges of stormwater from the Facility to exceed the acute criterion. According
to the 1989 Ambient Aquatic Life Water Quality Criteria for Ammonia (Saltwater 47), when the
receiving water temperature is 24.7°C, the maximum allowable pH of the receiving water is 8.5
SU, and the receiving water salinity is 30 ppt, the recommended warm-water acute criterion
value is 1.8 mg/L. When the cold-water temperature is 1.5°C, the recommended cold-water acute
criterion value is 9.4 mg/L. The 2014 Permit included quarterly monitoring for ammonia
associated with WET testing. From December 1, 2014 through October 31, 2020, ammonia was
detected above laboratory detection limits in 11 of 15 samples with a maximum value of 1.87
mg/L at Outfall 001. The results of EPA’s analysis indicate discharges of ammonia have a
reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above the State WQS (Appendix C).

As a result, the Draft Permit includes a maximum daily effluent limitation for ammonia (as N) of
1.8 mg/L for the warm weather period of April through October, monitored monthly.
5.2.9 Whole Effluent Toxicity
CWA §§ 402(a)(2) and 308(a) provide EPA and States with the authority to require toxicity
testing. Section 308 specifically describes biological monitoring methods as techniques that may
be used to carry out objectives of the CWA. Whole effluent toxicity (WET) testing is conducted
to ensure that the additivity, antagonism, synergism, and persistence of the pollutants in the
discharge do not cause toxicity, even when the individual pollutants are present at low
concentrations in the effluent. The inclusion of WET requirements in the Draft Permit will assure
that the Facility does not discharge combinations of pollutants into the receiving water in
amounts that would be toxic to aquatic life or human health.
The regulations at 40 CFR §122.44(d)(ii) state, “When determining whether a discharge causes,
has the reasonable potential to cause, or contributes to an in-stream excursion above a narrative
or numeric criteria within a State water quality standard, the permitting authority shall use
procedures which account for existing controls on point and non-point sources of
pollution...(including) the sensitivity of the species to toxicity testing...” In addition, under CWA
§ 301(b)(1)(C), discharges are subject to effluent limitations based on WQSs. Under CWA
§§ 301, 303 and 402, EPA and the States may establish toxicity-based limitations to implement
narrative water quality criteria calling for “no toxics in toxic amounts.” See also 40 CFR
§ 122.44(d)(1). The Massachusetts WQSs at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e) state, “All surface waters shall
be free from pollutants in concentrations or combinations that are toxic to humans, aquatic life
or wildlife.” Further, State implementation policy 48 specifies WET testing requirements as part
of its interpretation of the narrative criteria for toxic pollutants, stating that “[w]hole effluent
toxicity testing will be used to complement specific chemical testing.” This State implementation
policy establishes numeric criteria for toxicity. The State recommended criterion to prevent
acutely toxic effects is 0.3 toxic units (T.U.). This is based on an adjustment factor of one-third
used to extrapolate the LC50 to an LC1 (concentration at which 1% of the test organisms die).
EPA considered WET testing in addition to chemical specific criteria when evaluating whether
discharges from the Facility meet WQSs. The 2014 Permit required acute WET testing for
effluent and chemical analysis requirements for the receiving water quarterly for three years, and
once per year thereafter. The 2014 Permit required that testing be conducted for both the Mysid
Shrimp (Americamysis bahia) and Inland Silverside (Menidia beryllina). The State
recommended criterion to prevent acutely toxic effects is 0.3 toxic units (T.U.). This is based on
an adjustment factor of one-third used to extrapolate the LC50 to an LC1 (concentration at which
1% of the test organisms die). From December 1, 2014 through November 30, 2019, WET
testing results indicate a LC50 of equal to or greater than 100% in each of the tests completed for
both test species. Since no toxicity was detected in the effluent, there is no reasonable potential
to cause an excursion above the acute criterion for toxicity, and numeric effluent limitations for
toxicity are not required.

Waters. February 23, 1990.

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 45 of 106

In accordance with EPA guidance, 49 and as described in the Fact Sheet issued with the draft
2014 Permit, EPA determined that WET testing is warranted because: 1) the receiving water is
impaired for its designated uses; 2) the discharge is a source of these pollutants; and 3) one or
more of these pollutants are known to exhibit additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects. These
conditions have not changed since the issuance of the 2014 Permit. Therefore, EPA maintains
that WET testing is necessary to ensure WQSs are met when the discharge contains pollutants
not limited through chemical-specific testing, pollutants that have additive, synergistic or
antagonistic effects, for which bioavailability can vary. WET testing will also address monitoring
necessary for additional pollutants required in this permit reissuance for the discharge, the
receiving water, or both (e.g., metals in the discharge and receiving water). Therefore, the WET
requirements are necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of the CWA and ensure
compliance with State WQSs. See CWA §308(a), 33 U.S.C. §1318(a).
Toxicity testing must be performed in accordance with EPA Region 1’s test procedures and
protocols specified in Attachment A, Marine Acute Toxicity Test Procedure and Protocol (July
2012) of the Draft Permit. The Permittee must collect the required receiving water sample (i.e.,
diluent) from the Chelsea River at a point immediately outside of the permitted discharge’s zone
of influence at a reasonably accessible location. A receiving water control (0% effluent) must
also be tested. If toxicity is indicated, the Permittee may use alternate dilution water in
accordance with the provisions in the Draft Permit. Results of these toxicity tests will
demonstrate compliance with State WQSs.
5.2.10 Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
As explained at https://www.epa.gov/pfas, PFAS are a group of synthetic chemicals that have
been in use since the 1940s. PFAS are found in a wide array of consumer and industrial products.
PFAS manufacturing and processing facilities, facilities using PFAS in production of other
products, airports, and military installations can be contributors of PFAS releases into the air,
soil, and water. Due to their widespread use and persistence in the environment, most people in
the United States have been exposed to PFAS. Exposure to some PFAS above certain levels may
increase risk of adverse health effects. 50 EPA is collecting information to evaluate the potential
impacts that discharges of PFAS from wastewater treatment plants may have on downstream
drinking water, recreational and aquatic life uses.
On October 2, 2020, Massachusetts DEP published an Office of Research and Standards
Guideline (ORSG) level for drinking water that applies to the sum of the following PFAS: 51,52

See Policy for the Development of Water Quality-Based Permit Limitations for Toxic Pollutants, 49 FR 9016,

Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)
Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS)
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)
Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA)

Based on the ORSG, MassDEP recommends that:
1. Consumers in sensitive subgroups (pregnant women, nursing mothers and infants)
not consume water when the level of the six PFAS substances, individually or in
combination, is above 20 ppt.
2. Public water suppliers take steps expeditiously to lower levels of the six PFAS
individually or in combination, to below 20 ppt for all consumers.
In October 2020, MassDEP finalized revisions to 310 CMR 22.00: Drinking Water Regulation
that set a new PFAS Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 20 ppt (ng/L) for the sum of the
concentrations of six PFAS compounds, including all six compounds addressed by the ORSG
(listed above).
Although the Massachusetts water quality standards do not include numeric criteria for PFAS,
the Massachusetts narrative criterion for toxic substances at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e) states:
All surface waters shall be free from pollutants in concentrations or combinations that are
toxic to humans, aquatic life or wildlife.
The narrative criterion is further elaborated at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e)2 which states:
Human Health Risk Levels. Where EPA has not set human health risk levels for a toxic
pollutant, the human health-based regulation of the toxic pollutant shall be in accordance
with guidance issued by the Department of Environmental Protection's Office of
Research and Standards. The Department's goal is to prevent all adverse health effects
which may result from the ingestion, inhalation or dermal absorption of toxins
attributable to waters during their reasonable use as designated in 314 CMR 4.00.
Since PFAS chemicals are persistent in the environment and may lead to adverse human health
and environmental effects, the Draft Permit requires that the facility conduct quarterly effluent
sampling for PFAS chemicals, six months after appropriate, multi-lab validated test methods are
made available by EPA to the public.
The purpose of this monitoring and reporting requirement is to better understand potential
discharges of PFAS from this facility and to inform future permitting decisions, including the
potential development of water quality-based effluent limits on a facility-specific basis. EPA is
authorized to require this monitoring and reporting by CWA § 308(a), which states:

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 47 of 106

“SEC. 308. (a) Whenever required to carry out the objective of this Act, including
but not limited to (1) developing or assisting in the development of any effluent
limitation, or other limitation, prohibition, or effluent standard, pretreatment
standard, or standard of performance under this Act; (2) determining whether any
person is in violation of any such effluent limitation, or other limitation,
prohibition or effluent standard, pretreatment standard, or standard of
performance; (3) any requirement established under this section; or (4) carrying
out sections 305, 311, 402, 404 (relating to State permit programs), 405, and 504
of this Act—
the Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any
point source to (i) establish and maintain such records, (ii) make such
reports, (iii) install, use, and maintain such monitoring equipment or
methods (including where appropriate, biological monitoring methods),
(iv) sample such effluents (in accordance with such methods, at such
locations, at such intervals, and in such manner as the Administrator shall
prescribe), and (v) provide such other information as he may reasonably
require…”
A.

Since an EPA method for sampling and analyzing PFAS in wastewater is not currently available,
the PFAS sampling requirement in the Draft Permit includes a compliance schedule which
delays the effective date of this requirement until six months after EPA’s multi-lab validated
method for wastewater is made available to the public on EPA’s CWA methods program website
For wastewater see https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods/other-clean-water-act-test-methodschemical and https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods. EPA expects this method will be available by
the end of 2021.This approach is consistent with 40 CFR § 122.44(i)(1)(iv)(B) which states that
in the case of pollutants or pollutant parameters for which there are no approved methods under
40 CFR part 136 or methods are not otherwise required under 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N or
O, monitoring shall be conducted according to a test procedure specified in the permit for such
pollutants or pollutant parameters. After one year of monitoring, if all samples are non-detect for
all six PFAS compounds, using EPA’s multi-lab validated method for wastewater, the Permittee
may request to remove the requirement for PFAS monitoring.
5.3

Special Conditions

5.3.1 Best Management Practices
Best management practices (BMPs) may be expressly incorporated into a permit on a case-bycase basis where it is determined that they are necessary to achieve effluent limitations and
standards or to carry out the purpose and intent of the CWA under § 402(a)(1). BMPs may be
necessary to control or abate the discharge of pollutants when: 1) authorized under section 304(e)
of the CWA for the control of toxic pollutants and hazardous substances from ancillary industrial
activities; 2) authorized under CWA § 402(p) for the control of stormwater discharges; 3)
numeric effluent limitations are infeasible; or 4) the practices are reasonably necessary to
achieve effluent limitations and standards or to carry out the purposes and intent of the CWA.
See 40 CFR 122.44(k). Stormwater at the Facility has the potential to come into contact with

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 48 of 106

materials stored at the Facility or contamination in soil or groundwater from historical and/or
current activities. The Facility also periodically discharges hydrostatic test water.
The Draft Permit requires the selection, design, installation, and implementation of control
measures for stormwater associated with the Facility operations to comply with the non-numeric
technology-based effluent limits in the Draft Permit. In essence, the Draft Permit requires the
Permittee to implement and continually evaluate the Facility’s structural controls (e.g., OWS,
containment areas, holding tanks), operational procedures, and operator training. Proper
implementation of BMPs will minimize the potential discharge of pollutants in stormwater
related to inadequate treatment, human error, and/or equipment malfunction. The non-numeric
limitations in the Draft Permit, listed below, have been updated based on the limitations specified
in Part 2.1.2 of EPA’s MSGP.53 Non-numeric limitations include:
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•

Minimize exposure of processing and material storage areas to stormwater discharges.
Design good housekeeping measures to maintain areas that are potential sources of
pollutants;
Implement preventative maintenance programs to avoid leaks, spills, and other releases
of pollutants to stormwater that is discharged to receiving waters;
Implement spill prevention and response procedures to ensure effective response to spills
and leaks if or when they occur;
Design erosion and sediment controls to stabilize exposed areas and contain runoff using
structural and/or non-structural control measures to minimize onsite erosion and
sedimentation, and the resulting discharge of pollutants; the Draft Permit also proposes a
site-specific enhancement that the Permittee incorporate control measures to ensure bank
stabilization, including, but not limited to, the marine vessel dock and any seawall areas
owned or controlled by the Permittee;
Utilize runoff management practices to divert, infiltrate, reuse, contain, or otherwise
reduce stormwater runoff;
Develop proper handling procedures for salt or materials containing chlorides that are
used for snow and ice control;
Conduct employee training to ensure personnel understand the requirements of this
permit;
Evaluate for the presence of non-stormwater discharges. Any non-stormwater discharges
not explicitly authorized in the Draft Permit or covered by another NPDES permit must
be eliminated; and
Minimize dust generation and vehicle tracking of industrial materials.

In addition to the general limitations described above, the Draft Permit also includes BMPs,
either continued from the 2014 Permit or based on EPA’s Technical Support Document for the
2004 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan, EPA’s MSGP, and/or EPA’s RGP. 54 BMP requirements

Administrative control BMP: requires the Permittee to comply with the inspection and
visual assessment requirements in Part 3.1 and 3.2 of the 2021 MSGP and the corrective
action requirements in Part 5.1 through 5.3 of the 2021 MSGP; 55
Control Measure BMP: requires the Permittee to comply with the control measure
requirements in Part 2.1 and 2.1.1 of the 2021 MSGP in order to identify pollutant
sources and select, design, install and maintain the pollution control technology necessary
to meet the effluent limitations in the permit and[?] that ensure dilution is not used as a
form of treatment; 56
Discharge practices BMP: requires the Permittee, to the maximum extent practicable, to
avoid discharging stormwater, hydrostatic test water and groundwater during worst-case
conditions (i.e., the hour before and after slack tide and during periods of lowest
receiving water flow). The Draft Permit also proposes that the Permittee further avoid
discharging concurrently with the other facilities located along Chelsea Creek.
Effluent Flow BMP: requires the Permittee to document the measures and methods used
to control flow through both the stormwater and groundwater treatment systems to ensure
that the design flow of the treatment system is not exceeded;
Flammable Material/Fire Control BMP: requires the Permittee to design and implement
response procedures for ethanol, materials that are used for spill and fire control (e.g.
aqueous film-forming foam). This must include specific provisions for the treatment of
ethanol and/or pollutants in materials that are used for spill and fire control, should
release occur;
Major Storm Events BMP: requires the Permittee to implement structural improvements,
enhanced/resilient pollution prevention measures, and other mitigation measures can help
to minimize impacts from stormwater discharges from major storm events such as
hurricanes, storm surge, extreme/heavy precipitation and flood events. 57 This BMP
requirement is based on a similar provision in EPA’s 2021 MSGP;58 and
Quality Assurance/Quality Control BMP: requires the Permittee to document monitoring
requirements, sample collection procedures, sample analysis procedures, 59 a schedule for
the review of sample results and data validation and reporting processes.

Stormwater system BMP: requires the Permittee to eliminate discharges of groundwater
to the stormwater conveyance system if such discharges contribute pollutants and are not
otherwise explicitly authorized (e.g., internal Outfall 003) and implement routine
inspection and sampling to ensure identification and elimination. The Draft Permit also
proposes that the Permittee complete a cross-connection evaluation, to ensure that the
stormwater conveyance system does not contribute pollutants to or convey pollutants
from a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) to the receiving water.

The non-numeric effluent limitations support, and are as equally enforceable as, the numeric
effluent limitations included in the Draft Permit. The purpose of these requirements is to reduce
or eliminate the discharge of pollutants to waters of the United States. They have been selected
on a case-by-case basis based on those appropriate for this specific facility. See CWA §§ 304(e),
402(a)(1); 40 CFR § 122.44(k). These requirements will also ensure that discharges from the
Facility will meet State WQSs pursuant to CWA § 301(b)(1)(C) and 40 CFR § 122.44(d)(1).
Unless otherwise stated, the Permittee may select, design, install, implement and maintain BMPs
as the Permittee deems appropriate to meet the permit requirements. The selection, design,
installation, implementation and maintenance of control measures must be in accordance with
good engineering practices and manufacturer’s specifications and must take future conditions
into consideration.
As noted previously, the 2014 Permit included a site-specific discharge practices BMP, which
required the Permittee to avoid discharges during worst-case conditions, relative to slack tide and
periods of lowest receiving water flow, specifically. EPA requests comment on whether it is also
appropriate for the permit to require the Facility to avoid discharging at the same time as the
other petroleum bulk storage facilities along Chelsea River and/or whether it would be best to
require a permittee to sequence its discharge starting from the uppermost Facility (i.e., Global
Companies, LLC) and progressing downstream to the confluence with Boston Inner Harbor (i.e.,
Chelsea Sandwich, LLC). EPA believes this type of control could reduce the potential for
cumulative impacts.
One approach could be to use EPA’s Watershed-Based National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Permitting Implementation Guidance. 60 The Draft Permit for the
Facility implements controls on the near-field effects of discharges, that is, the predicative
impact of discharges from the Facility immediately downstream based on effluent and ambient
data, and no available dilution. However, regulated point source discharges to the Chelsea River
are located throughout the watershed in relatively close proximity. Therefore, the control of
watershed-wide loading from far-field lends itself to a larger-scale approach to worst-case
conditions and ensures water quality standards are met. EPA requests comment regarding how
such controls should be identified and implemented in the permit. It is in the interests of the
watershed and all stakeholders for EPA to make as informed a decision as possible on this
critically important issue, in order for EPA to select an appropriate permit regime (i.e., one that
will be effective on a watershed-wide basis).

EPA also requests comment on whether it is appropriate for the permit to require the Facility to
consider implementing enhanced controls to minimize impacts from stormwater discharges from
major storm events. EPA requests information on structural improvements, enhanced pollution
prevention measures, and other mitigation measures that the permit could require the Facility to
consider. EPA also requests comment on how the Permittee might identify areas of the Facility
that are at the highest risk for stormwater impacts from major storms that cause extreme flooding
conditions.
One approach could be to use the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Flood
Map Service Center (found at https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search) to determine if a facility (or
portions thereof) is in a “Special Flood Hazard Area” (SFHA) or “Other Area of Flood Hazard.”
SFHAs are defined as the area that will be inundated by the flood event having a 1-percent
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The 1-percent annual chance flood is
also referred to as the base flood or 100-year flood. SFHAs are labeled as Zone A, Zone AO,
Zone AH, Zones A1-A30, Zone AE, Zone A99, Zone AR, Zone AR/AE, Zone AR/AO, Zone
AR/A1-A30, Zone AR/A, Zone V, Zone VE, and Zones V1-V30. “Other flood hazard areas” (or
moderate flood hazard areas) labeled Zone B or Zone X (shaded) are also shown on the Flood
Map and are the areas between the limits of the base flood and the 0.2-percent-annual-chance (or
500-year) flood. The areas of minimal flood hazard, which are the areas outside the SFHA and
higher than the elevation of the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood, are labeled Zone C or Zone X
(unshaded). More information on FEMA flood zones can be found at
https://www.fema.gov/flood-zones.
According to the FEMA map(s) covering the location of the Facility, the marine vessel dock,
tank farm and portions of the terminal yard are within the SFHA and are classified Zone AE. See
https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search. The remaining portions of the terminal yard, including the
truck loading rack, are not within the SFHA and are classified Zone X. Id. EPA seeks comment
on whether it should use the FEMA maps to identify areas for which the Major Storm Events
BMP should apply and, if so, which classifications EPA should use and why. EPA also invites
comment on whether it should consider other data or information and, if so, requests that
commenters identify any such data and information with particularity.
As noted previously, the 2014 Permit included a site-specific stormwater system BMP, which
required the Permittee to evaluate the integrity of the stormwater collection system, and to
determine the relative contribution of pollutants, if any, from contact with potentially
contaminated groundwater and soil. The Permittee was specifically required to document any
stormwater system components that are potentially located below the annual high groundwater
table that are susceptible to groundwater infiltration and assess through appropriate measures the
level of infiltration that occurs (e.g., conduct a visual inspection of the readily accessible portions
of the stormwater collection system, and/or measurement of groundwater and stormwater
accumulation points as verification of segregation). EPA expects that these activities have been
completed, except the proposed evaluation of potential MS4 cross-connections. Therefore, this
BMP requirement has been updated in the Draft Permit as listed in this section, above.
This stormwater system BMP is necessary because the Draft Permit only explicitly authorizes
discharges of remediation wastewater, where captured and treated, and discharges of

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 52 of 106

uncontaminated groundwater or spring water (i.e., groundwater infiltration that does not
contribute pollutants). See Section 5.5.3, below. To further clarify the groundwater discharges
authorized under the Draft Permit, the Draft Permit explicitly prohibits discharges of remediation
wastewater, except via internal Outfall 003. In the event prohibited wastewater remediation
discharges (i.e., groundwater infiltration that contributes pollutants) have been identified or are
identified in the future, this discharge is now considered prohibited under the Draft Permit, and
the Permittee must follow the corrective action requirements described above to eliminate such
discharges. See also Section 5.5.6, below.
Finally, the 2014 Permit included a site-specific spill control BMP, which required the Permittee
to document methods and measures intended to reduce, minimize or eliminate the occurrence
and impact of spills, document the procedure for informing the appropriate entity of accidental
releases, and maintain a record of reportable releases. Since both the spill prevention and
response and non-stormwater discharges limitations are included in full by reference from EPA’s
2021 MSGP, these site-specific BMPs are redundant. As a result, EPA has not included them in
the Draft Permit. Where duplicative, activities documented under spill prevention and response
regulations (e.g., Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plan and Facility
Response Plan (FRP)) may be incorporated into the Facility’s SWPPP.
5.3.2 Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan
On September 9, 1992, EPA issued its general permit for stormwater discharges associated with
industrial activity, which, among other things, required all facilities to implement technologybased pollution prevention measures in lieu of numeric limitations and to prepare a Stormwater
Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) documenting the implementation of these measures. 61 The
general permit established a process whereby the operator of the industrial facility evaluates
potential pollutant sources at the site and selects and implements appropriate measures designed
to prevent or control the discharge of pollutants in stormwater runoff.62 This Draft Permit
contains BMPs for stormwater associated with industrial activity at the Facility. In addition to
BMPs, the Draft Permit also requires the Permittee to develop, implement, and maintain a
SWPPP for stormwater discharges associated with the operation of the Facility. These
requirements are consistent with Part 5 of EPA’s 2021 MSGP. The Draft Permit specifies that
the SWPPP must include the following, at a minimum:
•

The development and implementation of the SWPPP is an enforceable element of the permit.
The Draft Permit directs the Permittee to incorporate BMPs, as described above, directly into the
SWPPP, which serves to document the selection, design and installation of control measures
selected to meet the permit effluent limitations. The goal of the SWPPP is to document the
implementation of BMPs designed to reduce or prevent the discharge of pollutants to waters of
the United States either directly or indirectly through stormwater runoff.
The Draft Permit requires the Permittee within ninety (90) days of the effective date of the
permit to certify that the SWPPP has been prepared, meets the requirements of the permit, and
documents the control measures, including BMPs, that have been implemented to reduce or
eliminate the discharge of pollutants from stormwater associated with the operation of the
Facility. The Permittee must also certify at least annually that the Facility has complied with the
BMPs described in the SWPPP, including inspections, maintenance, and training activities. The
Permittee is required to amend and update the SWPPP if any change occurs at the Facility
affecting the SWPPP, such as changes in the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of
the Facility, or revisions and improvements are made to the stormwater management program
based on new information and experiences with wet weather events, including major storm
events and extreme flooding conditions. The SWPPP must be maintained on site at the Facility
and provided to EPA and/or the State upon request. All SWPPP records must be maintained onsite for at least three years.
5.3.3 Allowable Non-Stormwater Discharges
The 2014 Permit specified additional non-stormwater discharges allowed in discharges from the
Facility, provided the additional non-stormwater discharges meet all effluent limitations in the
Draft Permit. These discharges, listed below, have been updated based on the non-stormwater
discharges allowable under EPA’s 2021 MSGP. 63

Discharges from emergency/unplanned fire-fighting activities;
Fire hydrant flushings;
Potable water, including water line flushings (unless associated with hydrostatic testing);
Uncontaminated condensate from air conditioners, coolers/chillers, and other
compressors and from the outside storage of refrigerated gases or liquids;
Irrigation drainage;
Landscape watering provided all pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers have been applied
in accordance with the approved labeling;
Pavement wash waters where no detergents or hazardous cleaning products are used (e.g.,
bleach, hydrofluoric acid, muriatic acid, sodium hydroxide, nonylphenols) and the wash
waters do not come into contact with oil and grease deposits, sources of pollutants
associated with industrial activities, or any other toxic or hazardous materials, unless
residues are first cleaned up using dry clean-up methods (e.g., applying absorbent
materials and sweeping, using hydrophobic mops/rags) and appropriate control measures
have been implemented to minimize discharges of mobilized solids and other pollutants
(e.g., filtration, detention; settlement);

See Part 1.2.2.1 of EPA’s 2021 MSGP.

Routine external building washdown/power wash water that does not use detergents or
hazardous cleaning products (e.g., those containing bleach, hydrofluoric acid, muriatic
acid, sodium hydroxide, nonylphenols);
Uncontaminated groundwater or spring water;
Foundation or footing drains where flows are not contaminated with process materials;
and
Incidental windblown mist from cooling towers that collects on rooftops or adjacent
portions of the Facility, but not intentional discharges from the cooling tower (e.g.,
“piped” cooling tower blowdown; drains).

EPA notes that the routine washdown of the exterior of the tanks at the Facility is allowable
under these conditions. EPA believes this activity is encompassed by “building washdown/power
wash water” provided chemicals and/or additives are not added, unless in accordance with the
conditions pertaining to discharges of chemicals and additives, below.
EPA also notes, as previously described, the 2014 Permit contained non-numeric requirements
for the Permittee to identify infiltration of groundwater into the stormwater system. EPA expects
that these activities have been completed. The 2014 Permit authorized uncontaminated
groundwater or spring water (i.e., groundwater infiltration that does not contribute pollutants).
The Draft Permit continues to authorize discharges of uncontaminated groundwater or spring
water (i.e., groundwater infiltration that does not contribute pollutants). To further clarify the
groundwater discharges authorized under the Draft Permit, the Draft Permit explicitly prohibits
discharges of remediation wastewater (i.e., groundwater infiltration that contributes pollutants).
See Section 5.5.6, below.
5.3.4 Hydrostatic Testing
The tanks and/or pipe networks used for the storage and conveyance of petroleum products at the
Terminal sometimes require maintenance or repair. To ensure safe working conditions during
this maintenance work, storage tanks and/or pipe networks are rigorously cleaned (e.g., “Poly
Brushed”, “Squeegee Pigged”) and certified as being product-free. After completing
maintenance work, the vessels and/or pipe networks may be hydrostatically tested for leaks.
Hydrostatic testing involves filling the vessel or pipe with fluid under pressure and monitoring
pressure drops over time. If the system maintains a constant pressure, there are no leaks. River
water or potable water may be used as a source of hydrostatic test water. Thus, hydrostatic test
water discharge may contain minimal amounts of foreign matter, trace amounts of hydrocarbons,
background material found in the river or residual chlorine. Hydrostatic testing has not been
conducted at the Facility in the last five years.
As a precaution, the Draft Permit requires any hydrostatic test water to be monitored as described
in Part I.C.3 of the Draft Permit and treated through the stormwater treatment system prior to
being discharged to the Chelsea River. In addition, the Draft Permit requires control of the flow
of hydrostatic test water to prevent exceeding the maximum design flow rate of the OWS, 700
GPM. The Draft Permit requires the collection of a minimum of five representative samples of
the hydrostatic test water, and specifies the pollutants required. These pollutants include those
limited in the Draft Permit and the additional parameters that were included in the 2014 Permit,

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 55 of 106

based on requirements for this type of discharge surveyed in EPA’s ELG Document and/or
included in EPA’s RGP, Category IV – Pipeline and Tank Dewatering.
The Draft Permit requires the hydrostatic test waters released from the tank(s) and/or pipelines
and treated through the stormwater treatment system meet the effluent limitations and satisfy all
other conditions of the Draft Permit. In addition, the Draft Permit requires the Permittee to
routinely observe the surface of the OWS during discharge of hydrostatic test waters, in order to
detect any increases in the separated oil layer and to prevent inadvertent release of hydrocarbons
to the receiving water. In the event that there is evidence of such a release (e.g., visible oil sheen
and/or noticeable increase in turbidity of discharge water), the Draft Permit requires the
Permittee to immediately halt the transfer of hydrostatic test water and take steps to correct the
problem.
These requirements are intended to provide adequate characterization of the influent, in-process,
and effluent hydrostatic test water and are similar to requirements for similar facilities that
discharge hydrostatic test water to Massachusetts receiving waters under EPA’s RGP. Sampling
of the above parameters is necessary to identify whether there are any residual contaminants
present in the hydrostatic test water that might require the permit to be modified or reopened.
All discharges of hydrostatic test water are subject to the numeric and non-numeric effluent
limitations in the Draft Permit.
5.3.5 Discharges of Chemicals and Additives
Chemicals and additives include, but are not limited to: algaecides/biocides, antifoams,
coagulants, corrosion/scale inhibitors/coatings, disinfectants, flocculants, neutralizing agents,
oxidants, oxygen scavengers, pH conditioners, and surfactants. The Draft Permit allows the
discharge of only those chemicals and additives specifically disclosed by the Permittee to EPA.
The following chemicals and additives were disclosed to EPA:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Paints
Antifreeze
Oils and fluids – transmission fluid, hydraulic oil, compressor oil
Ice Melts and Road Salts – rock salt
pH adjustment – Vita-D-Chlor, sodium metabisulfite
Fire suppressant foams – foam seal oil, universal plus C6 3%/6% alcohol resistant, ARAFFF
Piping epoxys
Weed and pest control – Esplande 200 SC, Telar XP, Rodeo herbicide, Oust Extra
herbicide
Boiler chemicals

EPA recognizes that new chemicals and additives may become necessary at a Facility during the
term of the permit. As a result, the Draft Permit includes a provision that requires the Permittee
to notify EPA and the State in writing of the proposed discharge of a new chemical or additive;
allows for EPA and State review of the change; and provides the factors for EPA and State

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 56 of 106

consideration of such a change. The Draft Permit specifies that for each chemical or additive, the
Permittee must submit the following information, at a minimum, in writing to EPA and the State:
•
•
•
•
•

Product name, chemical formula, and manufacturer of the chemical/additive.
Purpose or use of the chemical/additive.
Safety Data Sheet (SDS) and Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry number for
each chemical/additive.
The frequency (e.g., hourly, daily), magnitude (e.g., maximum and application
concentration), duration (e.g., hours, days), and method of application for the
chemical/additive.
If available, the vendor’s reported aquatic toxicity (i.e., NOAEL and/or LC50 in percent
for aquatic organism(s)).

The Permittee must also provide an explanation which demonstrates that the discharge of such
chemical or additive will not: 1) add any pollutants in concentrations which exceed any permit
effluent limitation; and 2) add any pollutants that would justify the application of permit
conditions different from, or in addition to those currently in this permit.
Assuming these requirements are met, discharge of a new chemical or additive is authorized
under the permit upon notification to EPA and the State unless otherwise notified by EPA or the
State.
EPA notes that the 2014 Permit expressly prohibited the discharge of the following additives:
glutaraldehyde, ethylene glycol, butoxyethanol, alkyl acrylate nitrito styrene polymer, coco
alkylamine, 1,2,3 and 4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and methyl isobutyl ketone.
These additives continue to be prohibited in the Draft Permit.
5.3.6 Bioassessment
EPA recognizes that the Chelsea River aquatic habitats have been impacted by industrial activity
in the watershed. This includes the designated use for aquatic life and designated essential fish
habitat in the vicinity of the Facility’s outfalls. As described above, the Chelsea River is
impaired for, and listed as not supporting, the Aquatic Life designated use due to sediment
screening value. See Section 4.1 above. Contaminated sediments are explicitly noted as one of
the sources of this cause , and activities at the Terminals are listed among the sources of the
impairment to the Aquatic Life designated use (i.e., cargo loading/unloading, above ground
storage tank leaks, accidental release). In addition, the Chelsea River is impaired for the Fish
Consumption designated use, and while the cause of the impairment is noted as “other,”
contaminated sediments are also identified as a source. State WQSs at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(b) (b)
include narrative criteria for bottom pollutants or alterations, which states, “[a]ll surface waters
shall be free from pollutants in concentrations or combinations or from alterations that adversely
affect the physical or chemical nature of the bottom, interfere with the propagation of fish or
shellfish, or adversely affect populations of non-mobile or sessile benthic organisms.” State
WQSs at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e)3 also contain narrative criteria for accumulation of pollutants
applicable to all classes, which states, “[w]here appropriate the Department shall use an
additional margin of safety when establishing water quality based effluent limits to assure that
pollutants do not persist in the environment or accumulate in organisms to levels that: a. are toxic

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 57 of 106

to humans, wildlife or aquatic life; or b. result in unacceptable concentrations in edible portions
of marketable fish or shellfish or for the recreational use of fish, shellfish, other aquatic life or
wildlife for human consumption.
As referenced above, a 2005 United States Geological Survey study identified chemicals present
in sufficiently high concentrations in Chelsea River sediment to pose a threat to benthic
organisms. As described above, the types of pollutants in the discharges from the Facility include
sediment/solids, and pollutants that exhibit physical and chemical characteristics that can
accumulate in sediments. While the 2014 Permit included a site-specific ambient monitoring
program that required the Permittee to collect data regarding ambient water chemistry in the
vicinity of the Facility to address the impairments to the Chelsea River, this monitoring was
limited to the water column and did not address impairments related to contaminated sediments.
EPA has determined that such an assessment is needed to inform the extent of ongoing and/or
cumulative impacts to the waterbody and its designated uses, including as habitat for fish and
other aquatic life.
Specifically, the bioassessment requires the Permittee to collect: water quality data (e.g., water
temperature, turbidity); supporting environmental data (e.g., air temperature, precipitation); river
channel morphology data (e.g. cross sectional profile of the river depth); substrate
characterization data (e.g. grain size composition, total organic carbon (TOC) and benthic
infauna); benthic pollutant data (e.g, Part I.A.1 list of pollutants); and qualitative biological data
(e.g., macroinvertebrates, fish, aquatic macrophytes). These requirements have been proposed
largely based on EPA’s Estuarine and Coastal Marine Waters: Bioassessment and Biocriteria
Technical Guidance. 64 An example of a summary report and procedures, for reference, may be
found in the 2018 Boston Harbor Benthic Monitoring Report. 65 Test methods used for analysis
of water samples must be sufficiently sensitive. Water analysis must utilize test methods in 40
CFR Part 136. Sediment and biological sampling must follow Methods for the Determination of
Chemical Substances in Marine and Estuarine Environmental Matrices - 2nd Edition, whenever
possible. 66
These data will enable EPA to complete a comparative analysis during subsequent permit
development regarding the extent to which discharges from the Facility cause, or have a
reasonable potential to cause or contribute, to excursions above State WQSs. These data will
further inform whether the numeric and non-numeric effluent limitations (e.g., BMPs) in the
Draft Permit result in measurable improvement in the habitat and whether additional limitations
are necessary. Therefore, the proposed effluent monitoring requirements are necessary and
appropriate to carry out the provisions of the CWA and ensure compliance with applicable
WQSs as required by CWA § 402(a)(2) and 40 CFR § 122.4(d). See CWA §308(a), 33 U.S.C.
§1318(a). The 2005 data noted above, to the extent possible, will be used to inform the baseline
conditions.

The objective of the CWA, Section 101, is to “restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and
biological integrity of the Nation's waters.” 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a). Thus, the Act mandates the
restoration and maintenance of biological integrity in the Nation’s waters. The combination of
performing biological assessments and comparing the results with established biological criteria
is an efficient approach for evaluating the biological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. See also
CWA §§ 305(b), 301(h), and 403(c). Section 9.1.1 of EPA’s Permit Writer’s Manual notes that,
“[a]dditional monitoring requirements and special studies generally are used to supplement
numeric effluent limitations or support future permit development activities. Examples of the
types of special studies that could be required in an NPDES permit include…[s]ediment
monitoring,” included in a permit if pollutants contained in discharges may accumulate in the
sediments of the receiving water. 67 The application of sediment and biological monitoring in this
case will inform:
•
•
•
•

Measuring improvement or lack of improvement of mitigation efforts (e.g., BMPs).
Developing protocols that demonstrate the relationship of biological metrics to effluent
characteristics.
Performing aquatic life use compliance monitoring.
Helping to verify that NPDES permit limits are resulting in achievement of State WQSs.

EPA requests comment on: 1) the degree to which the permit requires the Facility to assess the
physical, chemical and biological condition of the bottom sediments, for example, utilizing a
different guidance; 2) whether this assessment is better conducted in conjunction with the other
petroleum bulk storage facilities along Chelsea River; 3) whether it would be best to require
permittees to sequence assessment over the entire permit term (e.g., starting from the uppermost
Facility (i.e., Global Companies, LLC) and progressing downstream (i.e., Irving, Gulf and
Sunoco) to the confluence with Boston Inner Harbor (i.e., Chelsea Sandwich, LLC); 4) the extent
to which existing data substitution should be allowed; 5) if a comparative analysis should include
hydrodynamic modelling conducted by the Permittee.
5.3.7 Prohibited Discharges
The 2014 Permit specified several discharges that are explicitly prohibited. These discharges
continue to be prohibited in the Draft Permit and have been revised as described below. These
prohibited discharges are based on EPA’s Technical Support Document for the 2004 Effluent
Guidelines Program Plan 68 and are necessary to protect the receiving water from the discharges
that are most likely to contain toxic pollutants.
5.3.7.1 Tank Bottom Water
The 2014 Permit prohibited discharges of tank bottom water. Tank bottom water is generally a
layer of water that has separated from the stored petroleum product in storage tanks due to the
density difference between the product and water. Because there is much more product than
EPA Office of Wastewater Management, Water Permits Division. NPDES Permit Writer’s Manual. EPA-833-K10-001: September 2010.

EPA-821-R-04-014 is currently available at: https://www.epa.gov/eg/effluent-guidelines-plan-support-documents.
67

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 59 of 106

water in a storage tank, as this water settles to the bottom of the tank, it can become highly
concentrated with water-soluble materials in the product (e.g., BTEX and PAHs). Whereas
stormwater primarily contacts only those hydrocarbons present at the ground surface and then
generally only for short periods of time, tank bottom water remains in contact with petroleum
products for prolonged periods. Facility operators drain this layer of water to prevent transfer
with the finished product as well as to free up storage space. As a result, EPA considers tank
bottom water process wastewater, since soluble toxic materials may partition from the petroleum
product into the water over time. Discharges of any tank bottom water, either alone or in
combination with stormwater or other wastewater discharges, are prohibited in the Draft Permit.
5.3.7.2 Solid Hazardous Waste
The 2014 Permit prohibited discharges of sludge and bottom deposits from any storage tank(s),
basin(s), and/or containment area(s) to the receiving water, such as the removal and disposal of
accumulated sludge during tank cleaning. While not necessarily emptied specifically for cleaning
purposes, a storage tank may be cleaned if it is emptied for maintenance or if it is needed to store
a different product. Examples of storage tanks and/or basins include, but are not limited to:
primary catch basins, oil/water separators, petroleum product storage tanks, baffled storage tanks
collecting spills, and tank truck loading rack sumps. The Draft Permit uses the term “solid and
hazardous waste” to refer not just to sludge and solid bottom deposits but to also more broadly
include any solids generated at the Facility that must be managed as hazardous waste. Discharges
of any solid hazardous waste, either alone or in combination with stormwater or other
wastewater discharges, are prohibited in the Draft Permit.
5.3.7.3 Liquid Hazardous Waste
Several liquid hazardous waste sources are described in EPA’s Technical Support Document for
the 2004 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan, which are common at bulk petroleum storage
facilities. For example, tank cleaning may include the recovery of water or detergents used for
cleaning. Product sampling may include small volumes of product released from sampling
nozzles and stations when the piping is purged of dead volume to obtain a representative sample.
Equipment drainage may include pocketing (i.e., product trapped in low points in the piping that
is not able to drain in either direction). Waste product (i.e., slop oil) is generated when petroleum
product does not meet product specifications and cannot be used or distributed as is. Discharges
of these, or any other liquid hazardous waste, either alone or in combination with stormwater or
other wastewater discharges, are prohibited in the Draft Permit.
5.3.7.4 Vehicle and Equipment Washing
Vehicle maintenance and equipment washing wastewater sources are described in EPA’s
Technical Support Document for the 2004 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan. Vehicles and other
product transferring equipment typically generate detergents or petroleum product residues. Such
wastewater could also contain oil, antifreeze, brake fluid, or other vehicle fluids. The Permittee
previously reported that vehicle washing does not occur at the Facility. Discharges of runoff
from any vehicle and equipment washing, either alone or in combination with stormwater or

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 60 of 106

other wastewater discharges, including from the leased portion of the property, are prohibited in
the Draft Permit.
5.3.7.5 Ballast Water
The 2014 Permit prohibited discharges of bilge water (i.e., ballast water). Tankers transporting
petroleum products may contain ballast water, which may result in wastewater contaminated
with product. These wastewaters are typically dilute and very large in volume and usually
require treatment such as oil/water separation, dissolved air flotation, biological treatment, and
air stripping. The effluent concentration of oil and grease reported for a facility that discharges
ballast water ranged from 3 to 5 mg/L. Discharges of ballast water, either alone or in
combination with stormwater or other wastewater discharges, are prohibited in the Draft Permit.
5.3.7.6 Accidental Spill and Release
The 2014 Permit prohibited discharges of runoff from spills and releases of petroleum products,
excepting conditions that meet the requirements defined in Part II., Standard Conditions. Several
sources are described in EPA’s Technical Support Document for the 2004 Effluent Guidelines
Program Plan, including leaks, tank deterioration, and product transfer mishaps. There are
various types of leaks, such as pump seal leaks, valve seal leaks, and piping leaks. Tanks can
deteriorate over time, causing leaks and rupture. Product transfer mishaps, such as tank
overfilling and accidental opening of nozzles can result in accidental releases. Discharges of
runoff from any accidental spill or release alone or in combination with stormwater or other
wastewater are prohibited in the Draft Permit. See CWA § 311.
5.3.7.7 Emulsion Chemicals
Emulsions, the dispersion of product in water or vice versa, are commonly referred to as “rag” or
“cuff.” Emulsions typically accumulate at the product/water interface because their density is in
between the densities of the product and water. Emulsions are stabilized by surfactants (e.g.,
detergent and soaps) collecting at the product/water interface, which reduce the surface tension
and inhibit phase separation. Several sources of emulsions are described in EPA’s Technical
Support Document for the 2004 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan, including product droplets,
surfactants, and fine solids. The 2014 Permit prohibited the discharge of surfactants, as well as
detergents, and emulsifiers, that were not disclosed in the permit application. However, because
petroleum product is separated from wastewater in an OWS by gravity separation, the addition of
surfactants, detergents and emulsifiers to the wastewater could adversely affect the separation of
petroleum product from wastewater. As a result, discharges of emulsion chemicals, including
surfactants (e.g., detergents and soaps), either alone or in combination with stormwater or other
wastewater discharges, are prohibited in the Draft Permit.
5.3.7.8 Wastewater Remediation
Soil, sediment and/or groundwater contamination at the Facility is a result of past operations,
current operations, or off-site contamination that has migrated on site. Several areas of the
Facility have undergone remediation at various times. Groundwater contaminated with dissolved

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 61 of 106

hydrocarbons is typically pumped to the surface, treated, and discharged. Soil contaminated with
petroleum hydrocarbons is typically treated using technology such as air sparging and may
generate dewatering discharges. Sediment along the bank disturbed during bank construction,
stabilization, and dredging activities typically undergoes dewatering (i.e., drain back waters).
The only wastewater remediation authorized by the Draft Permit is Outfall 003. In the event
additional groundwater or soil/sediment remediation/dewatering is conducted at the Facility
during the permit term, the Permittee is responsible for informing EPA and MassDEP and
obtaining coverage for wastewater remediation discharges, either by modifying this NPDES
permit or seeking alternative coverage for these discharges (e.g., RGP coverage). Discharges of
wastewater generated during remediation activities, including, but not limited to contaminated
groundwater, drain back waters, either alone or in combination with stormwater or other
wastewater discharges, are prohibited in the Draft Permit.
As previously described, the 2014 Permit contained non-numeric requirements for the Permittee
to identify infiltration of groundwater into the stormwater system. EPA expects that these
activities have been completed. The 2014 Permit authorized discharges of remediation
wastewater via internal Outfall 002. To further clarify the groundwater discharges authorized
under the Draft Permit, the Draft Permit explicitly prohibits discharges of remediation
wastewater, except via internal Outfall 002. In the event prohibited wastewater remediation
discharges (i.e., groundwater infiltration that contributes pollutants) have been identified or are
identified in the future, this discharge is now considered prohibited under the Draft Permit, and
the Permittee must follow the corrective action requirements described above to eliminate such
discharges. See Section 5.3.1, above EPA notes that in order for discharges from the Facility to
meet this prohibition, physical modification of the existing stormwater conveyance system may
be necessary. Therefore, EPA encourages public comment regarding whether the permit should
include a compliance schedule(s) and, if so, what the terms of any schedule(s) should be. See
Section 5.3.8, below.
5.3.7.9 Fire Protection Foam
Aqueous fire protection foam is used for fire and vapor suppression of liquid fuel fires. This
includes but is not limited to aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) and alcohol-resistant foam.
AFFF is a low expansion foam and can contain surfactants, solvents, or other additives such as
corrosion inhibitors, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).. 69 Alcohol-resistant foams
contain polymers that prevent alcohols from breaking down the foam. The 2014 Permit
prohibited discharges of AFFF either in concentrate form or as foam diluted with water during
testing or maintenance of the fire suppression system at the Facility. The Draft Permit continues
this prohibition. Refer to Section 5.3.4 for information regarding allowable non-stormwater
discharges related to emergency fire-fighting activities.
5.3.8 Reopener Clause

November 2017.
69

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 62 of 106

The 2014 Permit included a reopener clause because of the use of indicator parameters. Since
indicator parameters are included in the Draft Permit and in accordance with 40 CFR
§ 122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C), the Draft Permit continues to include a reopener clause. The reopener
clause in the Draft Permit allows EPA to modify or revoke and reissue the permit in accordance
with 40 CFR § 122.62, including if the limits on the indicator parameters no longer attain and
maintain applicable water quality standards.
5.3.9 Compliance Schedule
Several new or more stringent effluent limitations are proposed in the Draft Permit (e.g., TRC,
ammonia, cyanide, metals). The Draft Permit does not propose a compliance schedule. However,
in order for discharges from the Facility to meet the proposed effluent limitations, physical
modification of the existing treatment system may be necessary. Therefore, EPA encourages
public comment regarding whether the permit should include a compliance schedule(s) and, if
so, what the terms of any schedule(s) should be. Federal regulations provide that any such
schedule must require compliance “as soon as possible, but not later than the applicable statutory
deadline under the CWA.” 40 CFR § 122.47(a)(1). Thus, while a NPDES permit may not include
a compliance schedule to meet technology-based effluent limits, a permit may include
compliance schedules for meeting water quality-based effluent limits, provided that the schedule
would achieve compliance with such limits “as soon as possible.” See id. § 125.3(a)(2). Further,
if a permit establishes a schedule of compliance which exceeds one year from the date of permit
issuance, the schedule must include interim requirements and the dates for their achievement.
See id. § 122.47(a). Massachusetts regulations for schedules of compliance can be found at 314
CMR 3.11(10).

6.1

Federal Permitting Requirements
Endangered Species Act

Section 7(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA), grants authority to and
imposes requirements on Federal agencies regarding endangered or threatened species of fish,
wildlife, or plants (listed species) and any habitat of such species that has been designated as
critical under the ESA (i.e., “critical habitat”).
Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires every Federal agency, in consultation with and with the
assistance of the Secretary of Interior, to ensure that any action it authorizes, funds or carries out,
in the United States or upon the high seas, is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of
any listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. The
United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) administers Section 7 consultations for
freshwater species. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries (NOAA
Fisheries) administers Section 7 consultations for marine and anadromous species.
The Federal action being considered in this case is EPA’s proposed NPDES permit for the
Facility, which discharges treated: 1) stormwater runoff; and 2) hydrostatic test water through
Outfall 001 into the Chelsea River. Outfall 001 is located at Latitude 42º 23’ 7.4898” N
Longitude -71º 02’ 40.844” W . The Draft Permit is intended to replace the 2014 Permit in

NPDES Permit No. MA0003280

Page 63 of 106

governing the Facility. As the federal agency charged with authorizing the discharge from this
Facility, EPA determines potential impacts to federally listed species, and initiates consultation
with the Services, when required under § 7(a)(2) of the ESA.
EPA has reviewed the federal endangered or threatened species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the
expected action area of the outfall to determine if EPA’s proposed NPDES permit could
potentially impact any such listed species. For protected species under the jurisdiction of the
USFWS, no threatened or endangered species are expected to be present in the general area
encompassing the Chelsea River and the confluence of the Mystic and Chelsea Rivers. 70
EPA has determined that no USFWS federally protected species or their critical habitat overlap
with the action area of the Facility. Therefore, ESA section 7 consultation is not required.
Regarding protected species under the jurisdiction of NOAA Fisheries, a number of anadromous
and marine species and life stages are present in coastal Massachusetts waters. Various life
stages of the following fish, sea turtles and whales have been documented in these near shore
waters: Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus), shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrom),
protected sea turtles such as leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), loggerhead sea
turtles (Caretta caretta), Kemp’s ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys kempii) and green sea turtles
(Chelonia mydas), along with North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and fin whales
(Balaenoptera physalus).
According to general information from the NOAA Fisheries website, Atlantic sturgeon,
shortnose sturgeon, North Atlantic right whales and fin whales may be present in the general area
of the bulk oil storage facility (Chelsea River and Inner Boston Harbor). 71 However, when more
detailed NOAA Fisheries species tables were reviewed, none of the protected species identified
above are expected to be present in the Chelsea or Mystic Rivers or the Inner Boston Harbor.72
Based on this assessment, EPA has determined that no NOAA Fisheries federally protected
species are likely to be present in the action area. No taking of a listed species is anticipated or
exempted. 73 Therefore, consultation with NOAA Fisheries or the USFWS under Section 7 of the
ESA is not required. Initiation of consultation is required and shall be requested by EPA or by
NOAA Fisheries where discretionary Federal involvement or control over the action has been
retained or is authorized by law and if: 1) New information reveals effects of the action that may
affect listed species or critical habitat in a manner or to an extent not previously considered in the
analysis; 2) The identified action is subsequently modified in a manner that causes an effect to
the listed species or critical habitat that was not considered in this analysis; 3) A new species is
listed or critical habitat designated that may be affected by the identified action; or 4) There is
any incidental taking of a listed species.

2020 Fact Sheet

Essential Fish Habitat

Under the 1996 Amendments (PL 104-267) to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
Management Act (see 16 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq., 1998), EPA is required to consult with the
NOAA Fisheries if EPA’s action or proposed actions that it funds, permits, or undertakes, “may
adversely impact any essential fish habitat”. 16 U.S.C. § 1855(b).
The Amendments broadly define “essential fish habitat” (EFH) as: “waters and substrate
necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity”. 16 U.S.C. § 1802(10).
“Adverse impact” means any impact that reduces the quality and/or quantity of EFH. 50 CFR §
600.910(a). Adverse effects may include direct (e.g., contamination or physical disruption),
indirect (e.g., loss of prey, reduction in species’ fecundity), or site specific or habitat-wide
impacts, including individual, cumulative, or synergistic consequences of actions.
EFH is only designated for fish species for which federal Fisheries Management Plans exist.16
See U.S.C. § 1855(b)(1)(A). EFH designations for New England were approved by the U.S.
Department of Commerce on March 3, 1999. In a letter to EPA New England dated October 10,
2000, NOAA Fisheries agreed that for NPDES permit actions, EFH notification for purposes of
consultation can be accomplished in the EFH section of the Draft Permit’s supporting Fact Sheet.
EPA has determined that the Chelsea River is covered by the EFH designation for estuarine
systems at Latitude 42º 23’ 7.4898” N Longitude -71º 02’ 40.844” W, as determined by the
NOAA Fisheries EFH Mapper. 74 A list of the managed species and associated life stages
expected to occur within the EFH area, as well as a Habitat Area of Particular Concern, are
included in Appendix D.
EPA specifically noted that the documentation in support of the Boston Harbor Inner Harbor
Maintenance Dredging Project identified a “potential winter flounder spawning area” near the
confluence of the Chelsea and Mystic Rivers. 75 Egg, juvenile, larva and adult life stages of
winter flounder are covered under Essential Fish Habitat regulations and identified as occurring
in the Chelsea River (see Appendix D). This species is a commercially fished, federally
managed, bottom dwelling fish. Winter flounder eggs and larvae are typically found near the
benthic habitat in shallow areas. However, since winter flounder are expected to spawn on clean
sand, the deep navigation channels of the Chelsea and Mystic Rivers, with more silt by
composition, would not be expected to be high quality spawning habitat for winter flounder in
the vicinity of the Facility.
EPA has determined that the limits and conditions contained in this Draft Permit minimize
adverse effects to the EFH and the associated managed species, if present, for the following
reasons:

2020 Fact Sheet
Page 65 of 106

This Draft Permit action does not constitute a new source of pollutants. It is the
reissuance of an existing NPDES permit;
No water is withdrawn by the Facility from the Chelsea or Mystic Rivers, so no life
stages of EFH species are vulnerable to impingement or entrainment;
Acute toxicity tests will be conducted annually to confirm that the discharge does not
present toxicity problems;
The frequency of discharge from the Facility is limited, being intermittent and resulting
mainly from the accumulation of stormwater and the operation of the groundwater
remediation system;
The Draft Permit proposes limits on the oil/water separator flow, pH, total suspended
solids, oil and grease, benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene,
benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene,
indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene,naphthalene, total residual chlorine, total copper, total zinc, total
iron, cyanide, and total ammonia;
The effluent limitations and other permit requirements identified in this Fact Sheet are
designed to be protective of all aquatic species, including those with EFH designations;
The permit prohibits any violation of Massachusetts WQSs; and
The Draft Permit proposes a bioassessment special condition.

EPA believes that the conditions and limitations contained within the Draft Permit adequately
protect all aquatic life, including those species with EFH designation in the Chelsea River.
Further mitigation is not warranted. Should adverse impacts to EFH be detected as a result of this
permit action, or if new information is received that changes the basis for EPA’s conclusions,
NOAA Fisheries Habitat Conservation Division will be contacted and an EFH consultation will
be re-initiated.
In addition to this Fact Sheet and the Draft Permit, information to support EPA’s finding is
included in a letter under separate cover that will be sent to the NOAA Fisheries Habitat
Conservation Division during the public comment period.
As described above, EPA has proposed a special condition in the Draft Permit that requires
additional information that may inform the federal permit action’s essential fish habitat
consultation responsibilities under the Magnuson–Stevens Act. 76 Specifically, site-specific
environmental data are proposed to be collected in the vicinity of the Facility’s outfalls that are
the subject of EPA’s EFH consultation under the Magnuson–Stevens Act. 77 For more
information regarding this special condition, see Section 5.5.6, above.

Environmental Justice

Executive Order 12898 entitled “Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-Income Populations” states in relevant part that “each Federal agency shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as
50 CFR 600.920 (e)(4) Additional information.
50 CFR 600.920 (e)(4)(i); The results of an on-site inspection to evaluate the habitat and the site-specific effects
of the project.

appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its
programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations....” The
order also provides that federal agencies are required to implement the order consistent with and
to the extent permitted by existing law.
In addition, in May 2013, EPA Region 1 issued the EPA Region 1 Regional Implementation Plan
to Promote Meaningful Engagement of Overburdened Communities in Permitting Activities
which describes actions that the Region’s permitting programs will take when issuing EPA
permits in order to promote greater participation in the permitting process by communities that
have historically been underrepresented in the process. 78 It addresses four elements: 1) what
types of permits will be prioritized, 2) how these permits will be reviewed for EJ concerns, 3)
roles and responsibilities within Region 1 to carry out this plan, and 4) what actions Region 1
will take to ensure enhanced meaningful involvement where there are EJ concerns. Conducting
enhanced outreach for permits that impact communities that have been historically
underrepresented in the permitting process is a key element of Region 1’s efforts to help ensure
meaningful involvement.
Consistent with this plan, EPA’s enhanced outreach activities for the Draft Permit will include:
the release of a detailed EJ Analysis; phone calls and email notification to community
stakeholders; a 60-day public comment period; the release of a concise information sheet for the
benefit of the community, explaining in simple language the Draft Permit and the public process;
designating an EPA point of contact that the community can contact to discuss EJ concerns; and
translating key documents into the primary languages spoken by community members. EPA will
also host a virtual public meeting during which EPA will present an overview of the Draft Permit
and the EJ Analysis and answer questions from meeting participants. EPA will also host a
separate virtual public hearing to allow the public an opportunity to provide oral comments for
the record. In order to adhere to current COVID-19 guidance from the Centers for Disease
Control and state and local restrictions on large gatherings presently in effect, the meeting and
the hearing will be conducted virtually and will be accessible by computer, mobile device or
telephone. EPA will provide necessary translation and interpretation services in the primary
languages spoken by community members during the meeting and the hearing.
The Draft Permit implements water pollution prevention and control requirements, including
applicable technology-based and water quality-based limits, standards, and practices to ensure
compliance with applicable CWA requirements, and meet State WQSs. Where EPA determined
that a pollutant is discharged at a level that will cause, has a reasonable potential to cause, or
contribute to an excursion above WQSs, EPA has maintained or added numeric WQBELs. The
monitoring program is designed to obtain additional information, which can be used in ongoing
surveillance of permitted activities and in future permit decisions. Several additional special
conditions continue to be included in the Draft Permit to ensure adverse impacts do not occur
because of discharges from the Facility alone or in combination with other discharges from
similar facilities to Chelsea River. Additionally, the Draft Permit includes new numeric limits
(e.g., total residual chlorine, copper, zinc, ammonia, fecal coliform) that were derived from data

required in the 2014 Permit in response to concerns expressed by the public in public comments.
EPA has the authority to modify a permit if the threat of adverse environmental impact from the
discharges were to occur, that is, a discharge which violates State WQSs. EPA therefore
determined that the pollutant discharge levels authorized by the Draft Permit will not cause, have
the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above WQSs.
The water pollution prevention and control requirements in the Draft Permit will address current
adverse impacts to aquatic life, aesthetics and recreation in the Chelsea River, and the Draft
Permit will lead to continued water quality improvements in the river. EPA therefore has
determined that the facility’s discharges will not result in disproportionately high and adverse
human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations within the
meaning of Executive Order 12898. EPA’s evaluation and determination are discussed in more
detail in the November 2020 Environmental Justice Analysis for Clean Water Act National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permits for Chelsea River Bulk Petroleum Storage
Facilities, which is included in the administrative record associated with the Draft Permit
(MA0003280).

Appendix C: Reasonable Potential Analysis

Methodology
A reasonable potential analysis is completed using a single set of critical conditions for flow and pollutant concentration that will
ensure the protection of water quality standards. To determine the critical condition of the effluent, EPA projects an upper bound of
the effluent concentration based on the observed monitoring data and a selected probability basis. EPA generally applies the
quantitative approach found in Appendix E of the Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control (TSD)1 to
determine the upper bound of the effluent data. This methodology accounts for effluent variability based on the size of the dataset and
the occurrence of non-detects (i.e., samples results in which a parameter is not detected above laboratory minimum levels). For
datasets of 10 or more samples, EPA used the upper bound effluent concentration at the 95th percentile of the dataset. For datasets that
include one or more non-detect results, EPA used a delta-lognormal distribution to calculate the 95th percentile.
EPA uses the calculated upper bound of the effluent data and a concentration representative of the parameter in the receiving water
outside of the zone of influence of the discharge to project the downstream concentration after complete mixing using the following
simple mass-balance equation:
Where:

(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 − 1) + Ce = Cd (DF)

Cd = downstream concentration
Ce = effluent concentration (95th percentile of effluent concentrations)
DF = dilution factor (See Available Dilution section of the Fact Sheet)
Where there is no available dilution (i.e., DF = 1), the receiving water concentration downstream of the discharge (Cd) is equal to the
effluent concentration.
When the downstream concentration exceeds the applicable criterion, there is reasonable potential for the discharge to cause, or
contribute to an excursion above WQSs. See 40 C.F.R. § 122.44(d). When EPA determines that a discharge causes, has the reasonable
potential to cause, or contribute to such an excursion, the permit must contain WQBELs for the parameter. The limitation is calculated
by rearranging the above mass balance equation to solve for the effluent concentration (Ce) using the applicable criterion as the
downstream concentration (Cd). See 40 C.F.R. § 122.44(d)(1)(iii).

Determination of Applicable Criteria
State water quality criteria are derived from EPA’s National Recommended Water Quality Criteria: 2002, which are incorporated into
the state WQSs by reference at 315 CMR 4.05(5). For dissolved to total recoverable metal conversion, see Appendix A – Conversion
Factors for Dissolved Metals: http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/criteria/current/index.cfm#appendxa; as required by
314 CMR 4.05(5)(e). The criteria are presented in the following table:

Calculation of Reasonable Potential
EPA first calculated the upper bound of expected effluent concentrations for each parameter. EPA then used the calculated upper
bound of expected effluent concentrations, the permitted daily maximum effluent flow and the dilution factor to project the in-stream
concentration downstream from the discharge. When this resultant in-stream concentration exceeds the applicable criterion, there is
reasonable potential for the discharge to cause, or contribute to an excursion above water quality standards. The results are
summarized in the table below.

Value is an organoleptic effect criterion.

Note that when the effluent limitation is calculated to be lower than the applicable criterion, then the effluent limitation is set equal to
the criterion. Because regulations at 40 CFR § 122.45(c) require, with limited exceptions, that effluent limits for metals in NPDES
permits be expressed as total recoverable metals, effluent limitations are expressed as total recoverable metals. See EPA-823-B96-007,
The Metals Translator: Guidance for Calculating a Total Recoverable Permit Limit from a Dissolved Criterion:1996.

PREPARATION OF THE DRAFT PERMITS AND EPA REQUEST FOR CWA § 401 CERTIFICATION:
EPA is issuing for public notice and comment Draft NPDES Permits for the above-identified facilities,
which discharge some combination of treated stormwater, hydrostatic test water, groundwater, boiler
blowdown/condensate, and/or other allowable non-stormwater sources. The effluent limits and permit
conditions imposed have been drafted pursuant to, and assure compliance with, the CWA, including EPAapproved State Surface Water Quality Standards at 314 CMR 4.00. MassDEP cooperated with EPA in the
development of the Draft NPDES Permits. MassDEP retains independent authority under State law to issue
separate Surface Water Discharge Permits for the discharges, not the subject of this notice, under the
Massachusetts Clean Waters Act, M.G.L. c. 21, §§ 26-53.
In addition, EPA has requested that MassDEP grant certification of the Draft Permits pursuant to Section
401 of the CWA and implementing regulations. Under federal regulations governing the NPDES program at
40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 124.53(e), state certification shall contain conditions that are
necessary to assure compliance with the applicable provisions of CWA sections 208(e), 301, 302, 303, 306,
and 307 and with appropriate requirements of State law, including any conditions more stringent than those
in the Draft Permits that MassDEP finds necessary to meet these requirements. In addition, MassDEP may
provide a statement of the extent to which each condition of a Draft Permit can be made less stringent
without violating the requirements of State law.
INFORMATION ABOUT THE DRAFT PERMITS:
The Draft Permits and explanatory Fact Sheets may be obtained at no cost at
https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/chelsea-river-bulk-petroleum-storage-facilities-npdes-permits or by
