The grab samples for Outfall 001 shall be collected after effluents from internal Outfalls 002 and 003 comingle in the concrete vault
adjacent to the Terminal’s primary oil/water separator (OWS), during the first qualifying event that occurs for each required
measurement frequency, free from tidal influence. A qualifying event shall be defined as a discharge that occurs during daylight hours

NPDES Permit No. MA0003425

Page 7 of 29

on an outgoing tide at least one hour from both the low and high slack tide. To identify a qualifying event, the permittee may use tide
charts to predict the two four-hour intervals of an outgoing tide each day that are one hour from both low and high slack tide. If a
measurable discharge does not occur such that sampling cannot be completed during the first qualifying event of the required
sampling frequency, the permittee is to sample the next qualifying event. The qualifying event requirement does not apply to sampling
for the measurement frequency “when discharging”. Changes in sampling location must be approved in writing by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP). Sampling of
discharges from the Terminal must yield data representative of the discharge under authority of Section 308(a) in accordance with 40
Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) §122.41(j), §122.44(i), and §122.48.
2

Sampling frequency of when discharging is defined as the sampling of any measureable discharge event, reported for each calendar
month. Sampling frequency of monthly is defined as the sampling of one discharge event in each calendar month. Sampling frequency
of quarterly is defined as the sampling of one discharge event in each quarter. Quarters are defined as the interval of time between the
months of: January through March, inclusive; April through June, inclusive; July through September, inclusive; and October through
December, inclusive. The results of sampling for any parameter above its required frequency must also be reported to EPA, if it is
conducted in accordance with EPA approved methods consistent with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. §122.41(1)(4)(ii). Quarterly
sampling shall be performed concurrently with the monthly monitoring event. If no discharge occurs during the measurement
frequencies defined above, samples shall be collected during the next qualifying event and the Permittee must report a No Data
Indicator Code (e.g., “C” for “No Discharge”) found in Attachment E of NPDES Permit Program Instructions for the Discharge
Monitoring Report Forms (DMRs), available on the EPA Region 1 web site at
http://www.epa.gov/region1/enforcement/water/dmr.html.
3

All samples shall be grab samples taken within 15 minutes of the initiation of a discharge during a qualifying event from the outfall
where practicable, but in no case later than within the first hour of discharge from the outfall. All samples shall be tested in accordance
with the procedures in 40 C.F.R. §136, unless specified elsewhere in the permit. The practical quantitation limit (PQL) for each
analyte must be recorded. The PQL is the lowest concentration that can be reliably measured within specified limits of precision and
accuracy for a specific laboratory analytical method during routine laboratory operating conditions. When an analyte is not detected
above the PQL, the Permittee must report using the data qualifier signifying less than the PQL for that analyte (i.e. <0.1 μg/L, if the
PQL for an analyte is 0.1 μg/L). If no discharge occurs during a monitoring period, the Permittee shall follow the No Data Indicator
Code guidelines as noted above.
4

For Flow Rate, the maximum daily value represents the maximum instantaneous flow rate measured by the Terminal as passing
through the concrete vault adjacent to the Terminal’s primary OWS for each day that a discharge occurs during the reported period.
The maximum instantaneous flow rate, which is to be reported in units of gallons per minute (GPM), shall be an estimate based on the
summation of the pump curve value(s) for all pumps in operation which control the rate of flow through the treatment systems for
Outfall 002 and 003 when discharge is occurring.

NPDES Permit No. MA0003425

Page 8 of 29

5

For Total Flow, the value reported represents the sum of the recorded discharge volume for each day that effluent is discharged
during that month, from internal Outfalls 002 and 003. Total Flow shall be reported in the units of millions of gallons per month
(Mgal/Mo). The Permittee shall also report the total number of days during the reporting period discharges from the outfall occurred
(i.e., a measurable volume of effluent passes through the totalizer or similar device), noted on the discharge monitoring report (DMR)
form under “Event Total” parameter. Following the effective date of the permit and until the required meters for Outfall 002 and
Outfall 003 become operational, but no more than 180 days following the effective date of the permit, the Permittee may report Total
Flow as an estimate based on the sum of the estimated flow rate and the total hours of pump operation for Outfall 002 and Outfall 003.
6

Requirement for State Certification.

7

The pH of the effluent shall be in the range of 6.5 to 8.5 standard units and not more than 0.2 standard units outside of the natural
background range. There shall be no change from natural background conditions that would impair any use assigned to the class of the
receiving water. The Permittee may collect and submit as an attachment to the Terminal’s DMR, rainwater samples collected from the
Terminal in the event the permittee believes an effluent pH violation is attributable to the pH of the rainwater.
8

The minimum level (ML) for analysis for the Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) benzene shall be no greater than 2 µg/L. The ML is
not the minimum level of detection, but rather the lowest level at which the test equipment produces a recognizable signal and
acceptable calibration point for an analyte, representative of the lowest concentration at which an analyte can be measured with a
known level of confidence. Analysis must be completed using an EPA approved method in 40 C.F.R. §136, Table IC – Non-Pesticide
Organic Compounds.
9

The ML for analysis for the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) shall be no greater than the following: 0.1 μg/L for
benzo(a)pyrene and 5 μg/L for naphthalene. The ML for benzo(a)pyrene, 0.1 μg/L, shall represent the compliance level for that
compound. Analysis must be completed using an EPA approved method in 40 C.F.R. §136, Table IC – Non-Pesticide Organic
Compounds.
10

The Permittee shall sample and analyze for naphthalene using analytical methods for semi-volatile organic compounds and volatile
organic compounds. MassDEP methods may not be used.
11
12

Analysis must be completed for ethanol using a PQL for analysis equal to 400 µg/L or less.

The Permittee shall conduct a pollutant scan quarterly for Outfall 001 for the first three years following the effective date of the
permit, for the following compounds: benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene,
dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, fluoranthene,

NPDES Permit No. MA0003425

Page 9 of 29

fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, total xylenes, total recoverable chromium, total
recoverable iron, total phenol, tert-butyl alcohol, ammonia, and fecal coliform. The ML for analysis shall be no greater than the
following: 0.1 μg/L for Group I PAHs, 5 μg/L for Group II PAHs, 2 μg/L for benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and total xylenes, 1 µg/L
for total recoverable chromium, 50 µg/L for total recoverable iron, 5 µg/L for total phenol, and 10 µg/L for tert-butyl alcohol. PAH
and VOC analyses conducted for the pollutant scan may also be used to satisfy the monthly sampling requirements for those
parameters as long as the timing of sampling for the remaining parameters in Part I.A.1. coincides with the quarterly sampling of
selected pollutants. After three years following the effective date of the permit and 12 samples, the sampling frequency for the
pollutant scan shall be reduced to 1/year. The 1/year sample for Outfall 001 shall be collected in April. Sampling shall be performed
concurrently with the monthly monitoring event. After three years following the effective date of the permit and 12 samples, the
Permittee may request in writing, with supporting rationale, elimination of monitoring requirements for total recoverable chromium,
total recoverable iron, total phenol, tert-butyl alcohol, ammonia, and fecal coliform.
13

The Permittee shall conduct a pollutant scan quarterly for the receiving water for the first three years following the effective date of
the permit, for the following compounds: benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene,
dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, fluoranthene,
fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and total xylenes. The ML for analysis shall be no
greater than the following: 0.1 μg/L for Group I PAHs, 5 μg/L for Group II PAHs, and 2 μg/L for benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and
total xylenes. The receiving water sample for the pollutant scan shall be collected from the Chelsea River at a point immediately
outside of Outfall 001’s zone of influence at a reasonably accessible location. After three years following the effective date of the
permit and 12 samples, the sampling frequency for the pollutant scan shall be reduced to 1/year. The 1/year sample shall be collected
in April. Sampling shall be performed concurrently with the monthly monitoring event.
14

The Permittee shall conduct acute whole effluent toxicity tests (WET) quarterly for the first three years following the effective date
of the permit. The Permittee shall test the Mysid Shrimp, Americamysis bahia, and the Inland Silverside, Menidia beryllina. Toxicity
test samples shall be collected for Outfall 001 during September. The test results shall be submitted by the last day of the month
following the completion of the test. The tests must be performed in accordance with test procedures and protocols specified in
Attachment A of this permit. These samples, taken in accordance with the WET testing requirements, may be used to satisfy other
sampling requirements specified in the table above. After three years following the effective date of the permit and 12 samples, the
sampling frequency for WET testing shall be reduced to 1/year unless the Permittee requests, and subsequently receives written
permission to eliminate WET testing. The 1/year sample for Outfall 001 shall be collected in September. The 1/year sample shall be
collected in April. Sampling shall be performed concurrently with the monthly monitoring event. After three years following the
effective date of the permit and 12 samples, the Permittee may request in writing, with supporting rationale, elimination of monitoring
requirements for whole effluent toxicity.
15

The LC50 (Lethal Concentration 50 Percent) is the concentration of effluent which causes mortality to 50% of the test organisms.

NPDES Permit No. MA0003425

Page 10 of 29

16

The dilution water sample for the WET test shall be collected from the Chelsea River at a point immediately outside of Outfall 001’s
zone of influence at a reasonably accessible location. If the toxicity test using receiving water as diluent shows the receiving water to
be toxic or unreliable, the Permittee shall either follow procedures outlined in Attachment A – Marine Acute Toxicity Test Procedure
and Protocol ) Section IV., DILUTION WATER in order to obtain an individual approval for use of an alternate dilution water, or the
Permittee shall follow the Self-Implementing Alternative Dilution Water Guidance which may be used to obtain automatic approval of
an alternate dilution water, including the appropriate species for use with that water. This guidance is found in Attachment G of
NPDES Program Instructions for the Discharge Monitoring Report Forms (DMRs), which may be found on the EPA Region 1 web
site at http://www.epa.gov/Region1/enforcementandassistance/dmr.html. If this guidance is revoked, the Permittee shall revert to
obtaining individual approval as outlined in Attachment A. Any modification or revocation to this guidance will be transmitted to the
Permittee. However, at any time, the Permittee may choose to contact EPA Region 1 directly using the approach outlined in
Attachment A. For each Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) test, the Permittee shall report the concentrations of the parameters listed
above in DMRs submitted to EPA and MassDEP. Even where alternate dilution water has been agreed upon, the results of the
receiving water control (0% effluent) analyses must be reported.
17

In conjunction with each WET test, the Permittee shall report the concentrations of total residual chlorine, salinity, pH, total solids,
total suspended solids, ammonia, total organic carbon, total recoverable cadmium, total recoverable copper, total recoverable lead,
total recoverable nickel, and total recoverable zinc found in the 100% effluent and receiving water control (0% effluent) samples in
DMRs submitted to EPA and MassDEP, noted above as Whole Effluent Toxicity and Whole Effluent Toxicity Test, Receiving Water
Chemical Analysis, respectively. The ML for analysis shall be no greater than the following: 0.2 μg/L for total recoverable cadmium,
total recoverable lead, and total recoverable nickel, 0.5 μg/L for total recoverable copper, and 5 μg/L for total recoverable zinc.

are not being properly operated and maintained.
b. If any of the following conditions occur, the Permittee must review the selection,
design, installation, and implementation of control measures (including BMPs) to
determine if modifications are necessary to meet the effluent limits in this permit:
i. a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance, materials storage,
or activities at the Terminal that significantly changes the nature of pollutants
discharged in stormwater from the Terminal, or significantly increases the
quantity of pollutants discharged; or
ii. new data identifies the integrity of the stormwater system and level of
groundwater infiltration into the stormwater system.
c. If the Permittee determines that changes are necessary, any modifications to control
measures (including BMPs) must be made before the next discharge if possible, or as
soon as practicable following that discharge.
D. STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN

ATTACHMENT A
MARINE ACUTE
TOXICITY TEST PROCEDURE AND PROTOCOL

I. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
The permittee shall conduct acceptable acute toxicity tests in accordance with the appropriate
test protocols described below:
•

2007.0 - Mysid Shrimp (Americamysis bahia) definitive 48 hour test.

•

2006.0 - Inland Silverside (Menidia beryllina) definitive 48 hour test.

Acute toxicity data shall be reported as outlined in Section VIII.
II. METHODS
The permittee shall use the most recent 40 CFR Part 136 methods. Whole Effluent Toxicity
(WET) Test Methods and guidance may be found at:
http://water.epa.gov/scitech/methods/cwa/wet/index.cfm#methods
The permittee shall also meet the sampling, analysis and reporting requirements included in this
protocol. This protocol defines more specific requirements while still being consistent with the
Part 136 methods. If, due to modifications of Part 136, there are conflicting requirements
between the Part 136 method and this protocol, the permittee shall comply with the requirements
of the Part 136 method.
III. SAMPLE COLLECTION
A discharge and receiving water sample shall be collected. The receiving water control sample
must be collected immediately upstream of the permitted discharge’s zone of influence. The
acceptable holding times until initial use of a sample are 24 and 36 hours for on-site and off-site
testing, respectively. A written waiver is required from the regulating authority for any holding
time extension. Sampling guidance dictates that, where appropriate, aliquots for the analysis
required in this protocol shall be split from the samples, containerized and immediately
preserved, or analyzed as per 40 CFR Part 136. EPA approved test methods require that samples
collected for metals analyses be preserved immediately after collection. Testing for the presence
of total residual chlorine 1 (TRC) must be analyzed immediately or as soon as possible, for all
effluent samples, prior to WET testing. TRC analysis may be performed on-site or by the toxicity
testing laboratory and the samples must be dechlorinated, as necessary, using sodium thiosulfate
1

For this protocol, total residual chlorine is synonymous with total residual oxidants.

(July 2012)

Page 1 of 10

prior to sample use for toxicity testing. If performed on site the results should be included on the
chain of custody (COC) presented to WET laboratory.
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater describes dechlorination of
samples (APHA, 1992). Dechlorination can be achieved using a ratio of 6.7 mg/L anhydrous
sodium thiosulfate to reduce 1 mg/L chlorine. If dechlorination is necessary, a thiosulfate control
consisting of the maximum concentration of thiosulfate used to dechlorinate the sample in the
toxicity test control water must also be run in the WET test.
All samples submitted for chemical and physical analyses will be analyzed according to Section
VI of this protocol. Grab samples must be used for pH, temperature, and total residual chlorine
(as per 40 CFR Part 122.21).
All samples held for use beyond the day of sampling shall be refrigerated and maintained at a
temperature range of 0-6o C.
IV. DILUTION WATER
Samples of receiving water must be collected from a reasonably accessible location in the
receiving water body immediately upstream of the permitted discharge’s zone of influence.
Avoid collection near areas of obvious road or agricultural runoff, storm sewers or other point
source discharges and areas where stagnant conditions exist. EPA strongly urges that screening
for toxicity be performed prior to the set up of a full, definitive toxicity test any time there is a
question about the test dilution water's ability to achieve test acceptability criteria (TAC) as
indicated in Section V of this protocol. The test dilution water control response will be used in
the statistical analysis of the toxicity test data. All other control(s) required to be run in the test
will be reported as specified in the Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) Instructions,
Attachment F, page 2,Test Results & Permit Limits.
The test dilution water must be used to determine whether the test met the applicable TAC.
When receiving water is used for test dilution, an additional control made up of standard
laboratory water (0% effluent) is required. This control will be used to verify the health of the
test organisms and evaluate to what extent, if any, the receiving water itself is responsible for any
toxic response observed.
If dechlorination of a sample by the toxicity testing laboratory is necessary a “sodium
thiosulfate” control, representing the concentration of sodium thiosulfate used to adequately
dechlorinate the sample prior to toxicity testing, must be included in the test.
If the use of alternate dilution water (ADW) is authorized, in addition to the ADW test control,
the testing laboratory must, for the purpose of monitoring the receiving water, also run a
receiving water control.
If the receiving water is found to be, or suspected to be toxic or unreliable, ADW of known
quality with hardness similar to that of the receiving water may be substituted. Substitution is
(July 2012)

Page 2 of 10

species specific meaning that the decision to use ADW is made for each species and is based on
the toxic response of that particular species. Substitution to an ADW is authorized in two cases.
The first case is when repeating a test due to toxicity in the site dilution water requires an
immediate decision for ADW use by the permittee and toxicity testing laboratory. The second is
when two of the most recent documented incidents of unacceptable site dilution water toxicity
require ADW use in future WET testing.
For the second case, written notification from the permittee requesting ADW use and written
authorization from the permit issuing agency(s) is required prior to switching to a long-term use
of ADW for the duration of the permit.
Written requests for use of ADW must be mailed with supporting documentation to the
following addresses:
Director
Office of Ecosystem Protection (CAA)
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 1
Five Post Office Square, Suite 100
Mail Code OEP06-5
Boston, MA 02109-3912

Mail Code OES04-4
Boston, MA 02109-3912
Note: USEPA Region 1 retains the right to modify any part of the alternate dilution water policy
stated in this protocol at any time. Any changes to this policy will be documented in the annual
DMR posting.
See the most current annual DMR instructions which can be found on the EPA Region 1 website
at http://www.epa.gov/region1/enforcementandassistance/dmr.html for further important details
on alternate dilution water substitution requests.
V. TEST CONDITIONS AND TEST ACCEPTABILITY CRITERIA
EPA Region 1 requires tests be performed using four replicates of each control and effluent
concentration because the non-parametric statistical tests cannot be used with data from fewer
replicates. The following tables summarize the accepted Americamysis and Menidia toxicity test
conditions and test acceptability criteria:

V.1. Test Acceptability Criteria
If a test does not meet TAC the test must be repeated with fresh samples within 30 days of the
initial test completion date.
V.2. Use of Reference Toxicity Testing
Reference toxicity test results and applicable control charts must be included in the toxicity
testing report.
In general, if reference toxicity test results fall outside the control limits established by the
laboratory for a specific test endpoint, a reason or reasons for this excursion must be evaluated,
correction made and reference toxicity tests rerun as necessary as prescribed below.
If a test endpoint value exceeds the control limits at a frequency of more than one out of twenty
then causes for the reference toxicity test failure must be examined and if problems are identified
corrective action taken. The reference toxicity test must be repeated during the same month in
which the exceedance occurred.
If two consecutive reference toxicity tests fall outside control limits, the possible cause(s) for the
exceedance must be examined, corrective actions taken and a repeat of the reference toxicity test
must take place immediately. Actions taken to resolve the problem must be reported.

(July 2012)

Page 7 of 10

V.2.a. Use of Concurrent Reference Toxicity Testing
In the case where concurrent reference toxicity testing is required due to a low frequency of
testing with a particular method, if the reference toxicity test results fall slightly outside of
laboratory established control limits, but the primary test met the TAC, the results of the primary
test will be considered acceptable. However, if the results of the concurrent test fall well outside
the established upper control limits i.e. >3 standard deviations for IC25s and LC50 values and >
two concentration intervals for NOECs or NOAECs, and even though the primary test meets
TAC, the primary test will be considered unacceptable and must be repeated.
VI. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
At the beginning of the static acute test, pH, salinity, and temperature must be measured at the
beginning and end of each 24 hour period in each dilution and in the controls. The following
chemical analyses shall be performed for each sampling event.

NPDES PART II STANDARD CONDITIONS
(January, 2007)
PART II. A. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Duty to Comply
The permittee must comply with all conditions of this permit. Any permit noncompliance
constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and is grounds for enforcement action; for
permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or for denial of a permit renewal
application.
a. The permittee shall comply with effluent standards or prohibitions established under
Section 307(a) of the sludge use or disposal established under Section 405(d) of the CWA
within the time provided in the regulations that establish these standards or prohibitions,
even if the permit has not yet been modified to incorporate the requirements.
b. The CWA provides that any person who violates Section 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or
405 of the CWA or any permit condition or limitation implementing any of such sections
in a permit issued under Section 402, or any requirement imposed in a pretreatment
program approved under Section 402 (a)(3) or 402 (b)(8) of the CWA is subject to a civil
penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day for each violation. Any person who negligently
violates such requirements is subject to a fine of not less than $2,500 nor more than
$25,000 per day of violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both. Any
person who knowingly violates such requirements is subject to a fine of not less than
$5,000 nor more than $50,000 per day of violation, or by imprisonment for not more than
3 years, or both.
c. Any person may be assessed an administrative penalty by the Administrator for violating
Section 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the CWA, or any permit condition or
limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit issued under Section 402 of the
CWA. Administrative penalties for Class I violations are not to exceed $10,000 per
violation, with the maximum amount of any Class I penalty assessed not to exceed
$25,000. Penalties for Class II violations are not to exceed $10,000 per day for each day
during which the violation continues, with the maximum amount of any Class II penalty
not to exceed $125,000.
Note: See 40 CFR §122.41(a)(2) for complete “Duty to Comply” regulations.
2. Permit Actions
This permit may be modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a
request by the permittee for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or
notifications of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance does not stay any permit
condition.
3. Duty to Provide Information
The permittee shall furnish to the Regional Administrator, within a reasonable time, any
information which the Regional Administrator may request to determine whether cause exists for
modifying, revoking and reissuing, or terminating this permit, or to determine compliance with
this permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the Regional Administrator, upon request, copies
of records required to be kept by this permit.

Page 2 of 25

NPDES PART II STANDARD CONDITIONS
(January, 2007)
4. Reopener Clause
The Regional Administrator reserves the right to make appropriate revisions to this permit in
order to establish any appropriate effluent limitations, schedules of compliance, or other
provisions which may be authorized under the CWA in order to bring all discharges into
compliance with the CWA.
For any permit issued to a treatment works treating domestic sewage (including “sludge-only
facilities”), the Regional Administrator or Director shall include a reopener clause to incorporate
any applicable standard for sewage sludge use or disposal promulgated under Section 405 (d) of
the CWA. The Regional Administrator or Director may promptly modify or revoke and reissue
any permit containing the reopener clause required by this paragraph if the standard for sewage

8. Duty to Reapply
If the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated by this permit after its expiration date,
the permittee must apply for and obtain a new permit. The permittee shall submit a new
application at least 180 days before the expiration date of the existing permit, unless permission
for a later date has been granted by the Regional Administrator. (The Regional Administrator
shall not grant permission for applications to be submitted later than the expiration date of the
existing permit.)
9. State Authorities
Nothing in Part 122, 123, or 124 precludes more stringent State regulation of any activity covered
by these regulations, whether or not under an approved State program.
10. Other Laws
The issuance of a permit does not authorize any injury to persons or property or invasion of other
private rights, nor does it relieve the permittee of its obligation to comply with any other
applicable Federal, State, or local laws and regulations.

PART II. B. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF POLLUTION CONTROLS
1. Proper Operation and Maintenance
The permittee shall at all times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of
treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the permittee to
achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit and with the requirements of storm water
pollution prevention plans. Proper operation and maintenance also includes adequate laboratory
controls and appropriate quality assurance procedures. This provision requires the operation of
back-up or auxiliary facilities or similar systems only when the operation is necessary to achieve
compliance with the conditions of the permit.
2. Need to Halt or Reduce Not a Defense
It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been
necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the
conditions of this permit.
3. Duty to Mitigate
The permittee shall take all reasonable steps to minimize or prevent any discharge or sludge use
or disposal in violation of this permit which has a reasonable likelihood of adversely affecting
human health or the environment.
4. Bypass
a. Definitions
(1) Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
treatment facility.

Page 4 of 25

NPDES PART II STANDARD CONDITIONS
(January, 2007)
(2) Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can be reasonably
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
b. Bypass not exceeding limitations
The permittee may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause effluent limitations to
be exceeded, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of Paragraphs B.4.c. and 4.d. of this
section.
c. Notice
(1) Anticipated bypass. If the permittee knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice, if possible at least ten days before the date of the
bypass.
(2) Unanticipated bypass. The permittee shall submit notice of an unanticipated
bypass as required in paragraph D.1.e. of this part (Twenty-four hour reporting).
d. Prohibition of bypass
Bypass is prohibited, and the Regional Administrator may take enforcement action
against a permittee for bypass, unless:
(1) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe
property damage;
(2) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary
treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during
normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
(3) i) The permittee submitted notices as required under Paragraph 4.c. of this
section.
ii) The Regional Administrator may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Regional Administrator determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed above in paragraph 4.d. of this section.
5. Upset
a. Definition. Upset means an exceptional incident in which there is an unintentional and
temporary noncompliance with technology-based permit effluent limitations because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the permittee. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
b. Effect of an upset. An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with such technology-based permit effluent limitations if the
requirements of paragraph B.5.c. of this section are met. No determination made during

Page 5 of 25

NPDES PART II STANDARD CONDITIONS
(January, 2007)
administrative review of claims that noncompliance was caused by upset, and before an
action for noncompliance, is final administrative action subject to judicial review.
c. Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. A permittee who wishes to establish
the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(2) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated;
(3) The permittee submitted notice of the upset as required in paragraphs D.1.a. and
1.e. (Twenty-four hour notice); and
(4) The permittee complied with any remedial measures required under B.3. above.
d. Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the permittee seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof.

occurs only during a normal day (24-hour duration).
Maximum daily discharge limitation (as defined for the Steam Electric Power Plants only) when
applied to Total Residual Chlorine (TRC) or Total Residual Oxidant (TRO) is defined as “maximum
concentration” or “Instantaneous Maximum Concentration” during the two hours of a chlorination
cycle (or fraction thereof) prescribed in the Steam Electric Guidelines, 40 CFR Part 423. These three
synonymous terms all mean “a value that shall not be exceeded” during the two-hour chlorination
cycle. This interpretation differs from the specified NPDES Permit requirement, 40 CFR § 122.2,
where the two terms of “Maximum Daily Discharge” and “Average Daily Discharge” concentrations
are specifically limited to the daily (24-hour duration) values.

From which there is or may be a “discharge of pollutants”;

(b)

That did not commence the “discharge of pollutants” at a particular “site” prior to August
13, 1979;

(c)

Which is not a “new source”; and

(d)

Which has never received a finally effective NPDES permit for discharges at that “site”.

This definition includes an “indirect discharger” which commences discharging into “waters of the
United States” after August 13, 1979. It also includes any existing mobile point source (other than an
offshore or coastal oil and gas exploratory drilling rig or a coastal oil and gas exploratory drilling rig
or a coastal oil and gas developmental drilling rig) such as a seafood processing rig, seafood
processing vessel, or aggregate plant, that begins discharging at a “site” for which it does not have a
permit; and any offshore rig or coastal mobile oil and gas exploratory drilling rig or coastal mobile oil
and gas developmental drilling rig that commences the discharge of pollutants after August 13, 1979,
at a ”site” under EPA’s permitting jurisdiction for which it is not covered by an individual or general
permit and which is located in an area determined by the Regional Administrator in the issuance of a
final permit to be in an area of biological concern. In determining whether an area is an area of
biological concern, the Regional Administrator shall consider the factors specified in 40 CFR
§§125.122 (a) (1) through (10).

1. Proposed Action, Type of Facility, and Discharge Location
1.1
Proposed Action
The above applicant has applied to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) for re-issuance of a National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit to discharge treated stormwater runoff,
hydrostatic test water, and treated groundwater remediation effluent into the designated receiving
water. The current permit (“2005 Permit”) issued on June 30, 2005, modified on August 30, 2006,
and expired on August 30, 2010. EPA received a completed permit renewal application from Global
Petroleum Corporation (“Global”) dated February 23, 2010. Since the permit renewal application was
deemed timely and complete by EPA, the permit has been administratively continued pursuant to 40
CFR §122.6 and §122.21(d). The Draft Permit is based on, in part, the information provided in the
application. The Permittee also submitted a permit modification request to EPA on January 25, 2010,
to discontinue the use of its stormwater treatment system at Outfall 002. EPA concurred on March 3,
2010. As a result, Global requested relaxation of certain limitations at Outfall 002. This request is
addressed in pollutant-specific sections, below.
1.2
Type of Facility
The Global terminal (“the Terminal”), located in Revere, Massachusetts, receives, stores and
distributes petroleum products. The Terminal handles gasoline, and distillate petroleum products (i.e.,
diesel, kerosene, and No. 2 fuel oil). The Terminal is capable of physically blending some of these
petroleum products (e.g., high and low octane grades of gasoline and fuel oils). In addition to these
petroleum products, the Terminal handles and stores fuel additives such as ethanol. The Permittee has
also indicated that they intend to store and blend biofuels at the Terminal. The Terminal receives bulk
quantities of petroleum products and ethanol primarily via ship or barge at two co-owned marine
vessel docks located at adjacent terminals along the Chelsea River. Product is transferred through a
pipeline tunnel constructed underneath Lee Burbank Highway via above ground and below ground
piping to aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) located within the Terminal tank farm. Final distribution
of product is conducted primarily at the Terminal truck loading rack. Attachment 1 shows the
location of the Terminal.
1.3
Discharge Location
The Terminal is located on an approximately 28-acre site along the Chelsea River and Lee Burbank
Highway (Route 1A), in Revere Massachusetts. Lee Burbank Highway (Route 1A) bisects the
Terminal, with the tank farm located east of Route 1A-North (71 Lee Burbank Highway) and the
product distribution center and administrative offices located west of Route 1A-South (140 Lee
Burbank Highway) (see Attachment 1). The approximate latitude and longitude for the outfalls at the
Terminal are presented in Table 1. Attachment 2 shows the site plan for the Terminal, and the
locations of Outfall 001 and internal Outfalls 002 and 003.

2. Description of Discharge
The NPDES permitted discharge to the Chelsea River via Outfall 001 consists of treated: 1)
stormwater runoff; 2) hydrostatic test water; and 3) groundwater remediation effluent. Outfalls 002
and 003 are internal outfalls with individual effluent limitations, and monitoring requirements.
Outfall 002 consists of stormwater runoff and hydrostatic test water discharged into the stormwater
system. Outfall 003 is used to discharge treated groundwater into the stormwater system. Discharge
monitoring data from the previous five years (i.e., January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013) for
Outfalls 001, 002, and 003 are included in Attachment 3.
3. Receiving Water Description
The Terminal discharges its effluent through Outfall 001 to Chelsea River Segment MA71-06, which
flows from the east or west along the northern edge of the Terminal site, depending on the tidal stage.
This segment is 0.38 square miles between the confluence with Mill Creek, in Chelsea/Revere to the
confluence with Boston Inner Harbor, in Chelsea/East Boston/Charlestown. The Terminal is located
approximately 2.5 miles east of the inlet to Chelsea River at the confluence with the Mystic River and
Boston Inner Harbor. MassDEP classifies this segment of the Chelsea River as Class SB (CSO). 1
Class SB waters are described in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Surface Water Quality
Standards (WQSs) (314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)) as follows: “These waters are designated as a habitat for
fish, other aquatic life and wildlife, including for their reproduction, migration, growth and other
critical functions, and for primary and secondary contact recreation. In certain waters, habitat for
fish, other aquatic life and wildlife may include, but is not limited to, seagrass…These waters shall
have consistently good aesthetic value.” The Chelsea River is one of eleven Designated Port Areas
(DPAs) established by the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management to promote and protect
water-dependent industrial uses. The Chelsea River is part of the Mystic River Basin and the Boston
Harbor Drainage Area.
The Chelsea River segment MA71-06 is listed as a Category 5 “Waters Requiring a TMDL” on the
Final Massachusetts Year 2012 Integrated List of Waters (CWA Sections 303d and 305b) 2. The
pollutants and conditions requiring a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) are ammonia (unionized), fecal coliform, dissolved oxygen, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in fish tissue,
petroleum hydrocarbons, sediment screening value, taste and odor, and turbidity. This segment is also
impaired for debris/floatables/trash, which is considered a non-pollutant and does not require a
TMDL. The status of each designated use described in the Mystic River Watershed and Coastal
Drainage Area 2004-2008 Water Quality Assessment Report (WQAR) 3 is presented in Table 2.

The Aquatic Life, Aesthetics, Primary Contact and Secondary Contact uses are assessed as impaired
given the frequent oil spills in the Chelsea River and in the instance of the Aquatic Life use,
contaminated sediments. The WQAR identified the sources of these impairments as aboveground
storage tank leaks (from tank farms), accidental releases/spills and/or cargo loading/unloading
associated with bulk petroleum terminals, and municipal sources (i.e., an urbanized high-density
area). In the instance of the Aquatic Life and Aesthetics uses, the WQAR additionally notes
contamination of groundwater as a result of petroleum releases. Petroleum is explicitly listed as the
cause of these impairments. Regarding contaminated sediments as an additional cause of the Aquatic
Life impairment, a 2005 United States Geological Survey study identified chemicals present in
sufficiently high concentrations in Chelsea River sediment to pose a threat to benthic organisms. 4
The Fish Consumption and Shellfishing Designated Uses are listed as impaired as a result of PCBs in
fish tissue and fecal coliform, respectively. The WQAR also notes “other contaminants in fish and
shellfish”. The source of these impairments is listed as unknown.
4. Permit Limitations and Conditions
The effluent limitations and all other requirements are found in the Draft Permit. The basis for the
limits and other permit requirements are described below.
5. Permit Basis: Statutory and Regulatory Authority
5.1
General Requirements
The Clean Water Act (CWA) prohibits the discharge of pollutants to waters of the United States
without a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit unless such a discharge
is otherwise authorized by the CWA. The NPDES permit is the mechanism used to implement
technology and water quality-based effluent limitations and other requirements including monitoring
and reporting. The NPDES Draft Permit was developed in accordance with various statutory and
regulatory requirements established pursuant to the CWA and applicable State regulations. The
regulations governing the EPA NPDES permit program are generally found at 40 CFR Parts 122,
124, 125, and 136. In this permit, EPA considered (a) technology-based requirements, (b) water
quality-based requirements, and (c) all limitations and requirements in the current/existing permit,
when developing the permit limits. Section 402(p) of the Clean Water Act requires that EPA issue

Page 7 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
NPDES permits for stormwater discharges which were permitted prior to February 4, 1987, 40 CFR
§122.26(a)(1)(i).
5.2
Technology-Based Requirements
Subpart A of 40 CFR §125 establishes criteria and standards for the imposition of technology-based
treatment requirements in permits under Section 301(b) of the CWA, including the application of
EPA promulgated effluent limitations and case-by-case determinations of effluent limitations under
Section 402(a)(1) of the CWA.
Technology-based treatment requirements represent the minimum level of control that must be
imposed under Sections 301(b) and 402 of the CWA (see 40 CFR §125 Subpart A) to meet best
practicable control technology currently available (BPT) for conventional pollutants and some
metals, best conventional control technology (BCT) for conventional pollutants, and best available
technology economically achievable (BAT) for toxic and non-conventional pollutants. In general,
technology-based effluent guidelines for non-POTW facilities must be complied with as
expeditiously as practicable, but in no case later than three years after the date such limitations are
established, and in no case later than March 31, 1989 (see 40 CFR §125.3(a)(2)). A NPDES permit
cannot authorize compliance schedules and deadlines which are not in accordance with the statutory
provisions of the CWA.
Technology-based National Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs) were promulgated in 2000 for
discharges from washing activities at marine cargo handling facilities (40 CFR §442, Subpart C.,
Standard Industrial Code 4491). However, these ELGs do not apply because Global does not engage
in washing the interiors of tank barges or sea tankers at the Terminal. In 2003, EPA selected
discharges from the petroleum refining category (Standard Industrial Code 2911) for further review
for the technology-based ELGs to determine if a new subcategory for petroleum bulk stations and
terminals category (SIC 5171) was necessary. EPA determined in its Technical Support Document
for the 2004 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan 5 (“ELG Document”) that these facilities were better
regulated on a case-by-case basis using Best Professional Judgment (BPJ).
The Terminal is ineligible for EPA’s 2008 Multi-Sector General Permit 6 (MSGP) for stormwater
associated with industrial activity because discharges from the Terminal are already covered under an
individual industrial permit first issued before February 4, 1987. The Permittee does not have
separate coverage for discharges of groundwater remediation effluent or hydrostatic test line water
through EPA Region 1’s 2010 Remediation General Permit 7 (RGP).
In the absence of technology-based ELGs, the permit writer is authorized under Section 402(a)(1)(B)
of the CWA to establish technology-based effluent limitations (TBELs) on a case-by-case basis using
BPJ. The NPDES regulations in 40 CFR §125.3(c)(2) state that permits developed on a case-by-case
basis under Section 402 (a)(1) of the CWA must consider 1) the appropriate technology for the

category class of point sources of which the applicant is a member, based on available information,
and 2) any unique factors relating to the applicant.
Where appropriate, EPA evaluated the ELG Document, MSGP, RGP and ELGs for industrial sectors
with similar operations, pollutants, and/or treatment technologies in its case-by-case evaluation of
technology-based effluent limitations.
5.3
Water Quality-Based Requirements
Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the CWA requires that effluent limitations based on water quality
considerations be established for point source discharges when such limitations are necessary to meet
state or federal water quality standards that are applicable to the designated receiving water. This is
necessary when technology-based limitations would interfere with the attainment or maintenance of
water quality in the receiving water.
Under Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the CWA and EPA regulations, NPDES permits must contain effluent
limits more stringent than technology-based limits where more stringent limits are necessary to
maintain or achieve state or federal water quality standards. Water quality standards consist of three
parts: (1) beneficial designated uses for a water-body or a segment of a water-body; (2) numeric
and/or narrative water quality criteria sufficient to protect the assigned designated use(s); and (3)
anti-degradation requirements to ensure that once a use is attained it will not be degraded. The
Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards (WQSs), found at 314 CMR 4.00, include these
elements. The State will limit or prohibit discharges of pollutants to surface waters to assure that
surface water quality standards of the receiving waters are protected and maintained or attained.
These standards also include requirements for the regulation and control of toxic constituents and
require that EPA criteria, established pursuant to Section 304(a) of the CWA, shall be used unless site
specific criteria are established.
The Draft Permit must limit any pollutant or pollutant parameter (conventional, non-conventional,
and toxic) that is or may be discharged at a level that causes or has the “reasonable potential” to cause
or contribute to an excursion above any water quality standard (40 CFR §122.44(d)). An excursion
occurs if the projected or actual in-stream concentration exceeds an applicable water quality criterion.
In determining “reasonable potential”, EPA considers: (1) existing controls on point and non-point
sources of pollution; (2) pollutant concentration and variability in the effluent and receiving water as
determined from the permit's re-issuance application, monthly discharge monitoring reports (DMRs),
and State and Federal Water Quality Reports; (3) sensitivity of the indicator species used in toxicity
testing; (4) known water quality impacts of processes on waste waters; and (5) where appropriate,
dilution of the effluent in the receiving water.
5.4
Anti-Backsliding
A permit may not be renewed, reissued or modified with less stringent limitations or conditions than
those contained in the previous permit unless in compliance with the anti-backsliding requirements of
the CWA [see Sections 402(o) and 303(d)(4) of the CWA and 40 CFR §122.44(l)(1 and 2)]. EPA's
anti-backsliding provisions prohibit the relaxation of permit limits, standards, and conditions except
under certain circumstances. Effluent limits based on BPJ, water quality, and state certification

Page 9 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
requirements must also meet the anti-backsliding provisions found at Section 402(o) and 303(d)(4) of
the CWA.
All proposed limitations in the Draft Permit are at least as stringent as limitations included in the
2005 Permit. Therefore, the Draft Permit complies with the anti-backsliding requirements of the
CWA.
5.5
Anti-Degradation
Federal regulations found at 40 CFR §131.12 require states to develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy which maintains and protects existing instream water uses and the level of water
quality necessary to protect the existing uses, and maintains the quality of waters which exceed levels
necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and to support recreation in and on
the water. The Massachusetts Anti-degradation Regulations are found at 314 CMR 4.04. There are no
new or increased discharges being proposed with this permit reissuance. Therefore, EPA does not
believe that the MassDEP is required to conduct an anti-degradation review regarding this permit
reissuance.
5.6
State Certification
Under Section 401 of the CWA, EPA is required to obtain certification from the state in which the
discharge is located that all water quality standards or other applicable requirements of state law, in
accordance with Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the CWA, are satisfied. EPA permits are to include any
conditions required in the state’s certification as being necessary to ensure compliance with state
water quality standards or other applicable requirements of state law. See CWA Section 401(a) and
40 CFR §124.53(e). Regulations governing state certification are set out at 40 CFR §124.53 and
§124.55. EPA regulations pertaining to permit limits based upon water quality standards and state
requirements are contained in 40 CFR §122.44(d).
6. Explanation of the Permit’s Effluent Limitations
6.1
Facility Information
The Terminal, which comprises approximately 17 acres, consists of a tank farm, and a terminal yard,
which includes a truck loading rack and a rail car off-loading rack (currently not in use).
The Terminal receives petroleum products through two marine vessel bulk unloading facilities
located on the Chelsea River, with the exception of a limited inventory of petroleum products and
fuel additives provided by truck. One marine vessel dock (“south dock”) is located behind the Irving
Oil Terminals, Inc. (“Irving”) Terminal (NPDES Permit No. MA0001929) and is jointly owned by
Global and Irving. The second marine vessel dock (“north dock”) is owned by Global REVCO
Terminal, LLC (NPDES Permit No. MA0003298). An inter-terminal pipeline allows Global to
receive product deliveries from the north and south docks. Product transferred from the marine vessel
docks is piped to the tank farm located on the opposite side of Lee Burbank Highway (71 Lee
Burbank Highway).
The tank farm, located at 71 Lee Burbank Highway, covers an area of approximately 11.5 acres, and
consists of seven vertical above ground bulk aboveground storage tanks (ASTs), secondary

Page 10 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
containment, a network of product piping, stormwater run-off collection catch basins, underground
water collection drains, and a vapor recovery unit (VRU). The total storage capacity of the ASTs is
approximately 525,000 barrels (22 million gallons). A 200-gallon underground storage tank (UST),
used in conjunction with the VRU, is emptied as needed. The contents are reused at the Terminal.
The terminal yard, located at 140 Lee Burbank Highway, consists of an office, warehouse, parking
area, truck loading rack, rail car unloading rack (currently not in use), product transfer lines, a
stormwater treatment system and a groundwater/soil remediation system. Eight fuel additive tanks,
which have a total storage capacity of approximately 48,000 gallons, are located within the
warehouse building. There are also several smaller aboveground tanks used to store fuel for the
Terminal’s own use and are either double walled or placed inside secondary containment. The
Terminal yard contains one 4,000-gallon UST used to store diesel fuel that can be dispensed to tanker
trucks. A railroad easement with rail car offloading rack is located near the Terminal office and is not
currently in use.
Final distribution of product occurs at the truck loading rack, located in the terminal yard, or the
marine vessel docks. The Terminal is also capable of transferring product to adjacent terminals via
inter-terminal pipeline network. The truck loading rack consists of 17 loading bays of which six are
top loading bays and 11 are bottom loading bays. The Terminal also actively operates four pump-off
stations, used to off load product from tanker trucks. Three of these pump-off stations are located in
the terminal yard, two of which are used to off-load additive product to small ASTs and one of which
is connected directly to bulk AST Tank 26. The fourth, located inside the tank farm, is used to offload product into the seven bulk ASTs.
6.2
Permitted Outfalls
The Draft Permit authorizes discharges to the Chelsea River via Outfall 001 consisting of treated: 1)
stormwater runoff and hydrostatic test water from internal Outfall 002; and 2) groundwater
remediation effluent from internal Outfall 003. Discharges are limited and monitored at internal
Outfalls 002 and 003 prior to mixing with any other waste stream. A schematic showing flow
contributions to Outfall 001 is presented in Attachment 4.
6.2.1
Stormwater
Stormwater is collected at the Terminal from the following areas: 1) tank farm; and 2) terminal yard.
The tank farm and Terminal yard, located on the either side of Lee Burbank Highway, have their own
stormwater collection systems. However, the treatment of stormwater occurs in one OWS and the
discharge from all areas of the Terminal occurs via Outfall 001 into the Chelsea River.
Secondary containment for the tank farm consists of earthen berms surrounding each of the bulk
storage tanks as well as a perimeter berm surrounding the tank farm. The secondary containment is
sized to hold at least the volume of the largest tank’s storage capacity plus approximately 10 percent
of the volume of the largest tank’s storage capacity to hold any stormwater and/or precipitation, or
fire-suppressing materials. The berms are used to help prevent any potentially spilled petroleum
products from migrating from one secondary containment area to another or into surrounding
waterways. There is a valve located directly outside of each secondary containment area, which is
opened to drain stormwater into the stormwater collection system. Terminal personnel retain

Page 11 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
stormwater within that containment or cease discharge in the event that oil sheen is observed by
closing the valve.
The total site area is approximately 17 acres. The tank farm covers a drainage area of approximately
11.5 acres and the terminal yard covers a drainage area of approximately 5.5 acres. Stormwater
accumulating within the tank farm drains to low elevation catch basins. When the stormwater control
valve located outside each containment area is opened, the stormwater flows into the underground
stormwater collection system. The stormwater flows by gravity to an approximately 3,500-gallon
concrete retention basin located in the northwest corner of the tank farm area equipped with a valve
located at the discharge end. When this valve is opened, water flows by gravity underneath Lee
Burbank Highway to a lift station adjacent to the OWS located in the terminal yard. Stormwater
runoff within the terminal yard is directed toward several low elevation catch basins, enters the
underground stormwater collection system and flows by gravity to the lift station adjacent to the
OWS.
There are two pumps located within the lift station, each with a pumping capacity of 450 gallons per
minute (GPM). Under normal conditions, only one pump is operated. However, under flood
conditions both pumps can be operated simultaneously. The pump(s) transfer stormwater from the lift
station to a nearby in-ground OWS. The OWS is a baffle/weir unit with a storage capacity of
approximately 40,000 gallons and a maximum design flow capacity of approximately 830 GPM.
During the Permit term, additional treatment was provided to the stormwater through a temporary
treatment system. A manually-activated sump pump suspended in the discharge chamber of the OWS
transferred the stormwater to the stormwater treatment system consisting of granular activated
carbon. The maximum design flow rate of the sump pump was 70 GPM. The Permittee submitted a
permit modification request to EPA on January 25, 2010, to discontinue the use of its stormwater
treatment system at Outfall 002. EPA concurred on March 3, 2010. The stormwater treatment system
is no longer connected to Outfall 002, however, the system remains on site and is used on an asneeded basis. The treated stormwater is discharged into a concrete vault located adjacent to the OWS,
which also receives treated groundwater from internal Outfall 003. From the vault, the effluent flows
by gravity to the Chelsea River via Outfall 001.
6.2.2
Hydrostatic Test Water
The aboveground storage tanks are subject to annual external inspections (502 CMR 5.00) and their
integrity is certified annually by a licensed tank inspector. Internal inspections of the above ground
storage tanks are conducted every 10 years. The testing procedures followed are detailed in API 653
Standard. In addition, repairs are occasionally made at the Terminal to tanks and piping used for the
storage and conveyance of petroleum products and additives. To ensure safe working conditions
during this maintenance work, storage tanks and/or pipe networks are rigorously cleaned (e.g. “Poly
Brushed”, “Squeegee Pigged”) and certified as being product-free. After completing certain
maintenance work, the vessels and/or pipe networks may be hydrostatically tested for leaks.
Hydrostatic testing involves filling the vessel or pipe with water under pressure and monitoring
pressure drops over time. If the system maintains a constant pressure, there are no leaks. River water
or potable water may be used as a source of hydrostatic test water. Thus, hydrostatic test water
discharge may contain minimal amounts of foreign matter, trace amounts of hydrocarbons,
background material found in the river, or residual chlorine. Hydrostatic-test water discharges have

Page 12 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
not been reported at the Terminal for the last five years. The Terminal discharges hydrostatic test
water via internal Outfall 002 and must meet all effluent limitations in the permit.
6.2.3 Groundwater Remediation Effluent
There is groundwater and soil remediation ongoing at the Terminal under the Massachusetts
Contingency Plan (MCP) (310 CMR 40.0000). The main area of contamination is located under the
loading rack area and consists of gasoline from a historic failure of a product line. During the 2005
Permit term, Global replaced a temporary treatment system with a permanent groundwater recovery
and treatment system. The groundwater remediation system consists of soil vapor extraction (SVE),
groundwater extraction and treatment, and product recovery.
The groundwater remediation system uses horizontal trenches designed to remove contaminated soil
vapor, contaminated groundwater, and free-floating product. Each of the trenches installed in and
around the truck loading rack area contain three extraction pipes: 1) a soil vapor extraction pipe
approximately 1.5 feet below ground surface; 2) a shallow groundwater extraction pipe
approximately 2.5 feet below ground surface; and 3) a deep groundwater extraction pipe
approximately 5 feet below ground surface. There are five collection points, four of which are vaults
located along the trench and one recovery well equipped with a float-activated pump. The vaults are
installed with skimmer pumps that float on top of the groundwater and submersible pumps. The
skimmer pumps extract free product and the submersible pumps extract groundwater. The soil vapor
is extracted by vacuum. Extracted soil vapor, groundwater, and product are piped to the groundwater
treatment system, which consists of the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Flow equalization tank;
Treatment through an OWS;
Chemical and physical treatment through two compartments;
Filtration through a multi-media filter;
Removal of volatile organic compounds using an air stripper; and
Carbon adsorption through liquid and vapor-phase carbon units.

Extracted groundwater is first pumped into an equalization tank. From the equalization tank, water
flows into an OWS and through a physical/chemical treatment system for metals removal. The
physical/chemical treatment system consists of two compartments, one for pH/chemical adjustment
and another to separate solids. The pre-treated water is then passed through a sand filter. The filtered
water is then treated in an air stripper to remove the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Finally,
the treated water is polished via liquid phase carbon. The treatment system is designed to operate at a
maximum flow rate of 50 GPM. The groundwater treatment system effluent is discharged into the
same concrete vault located adjacent to the OWS associated with internal Outfall 002. Internal
Outfall 003 was established in the 2005 Permit upstream of the concrete vault to ensure that
monitoring results reflect the true characteristics of the remediation waste stream and not the
stormwater and hydrostatic test water with which it is being mixed (see 40 CFR §122.45(h)).
6.2.4 Off-Site Stormwater
The 2005 Permit authorized under certain conditions the transfer of stormwater from the tank farm
area of the Global Petroleum Corporation to the adjacent Global South LLC Terminal (NPDES

Page 13 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
Permit No. MA0000825) for treatment. Such transfers were allowed due to the more limited rate at
which stormwater could be treated and processed through the stormwater treatment system formerly
installed after the Global Petroleum Corporation terminal’s OWS.
In February of 1997, Global identified a release of gasoline in the vicinity of the truck loading rack at
the Global Petroleum Corporation terminal. Global notified MassDEP, contained spilled material,
and conducted hydrostatic testing of the gasoline product lines to identify the source of the release.
Additional investigation identified several potential sources of infiltration of groundwater into the
stormwater conveyance system, which were grouted to prevent further infiltration. Global estimated
that at least several thousand gallons of gasoline were released into the environment based on the
amount of product recovered in the months after the spill was reported. The gasoline was released to
the environment when the gasoline came into contact with the groundwater table, and migrated
through groundwater into the stormwater conveyance system.
Following the release, Global temporarily collected product in the stormwater collection system until
a groundwater remediation system could be designed and constructed to treat water discharging
through the stormwater collection system. This treatment system was required by MassDEP. Global
also installed a temporary stormwater treatment system consisting of two sets of bag filters connected
in series and two 2,000-pound liquid phase granular activated carbon units connected in series. The
stormwater treatment system was designed to remove MtBE to meet a permit effluent limitation of 70
µg/L. Global is also under an agreement with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to fully inspect
and seal the entire drainage system triennially. Areas of infiltration, if identified using remote
cameras, are sealed by pressure injecting grout, installing a pipe liner or replacing pipe.
As noted above, the Permittee disconnected this stormwater treatment system. The Permittee
supported this change with a Licensed Site Professional Statement Letter, and referenced several
years of effluent and groundwater analytical data to conclude that “continued stormwater processing
is no longer required under the MCP since Oil and Hazardous Materials (OHM) have been
controlled as required per 310 CMR 40.0893 and all NPDES permit effluent limitations for MtBE
and other NPDES permit volatile organic compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes
[BTEX]) and total petroleum hydrocarbons [TPH], are being met.” The Permittee also stated in the
permit renewal application that the Terminal was successful in sealing the stormwater collection
system. Based on monitoring data collected at Outfall 002 since use of the system was discontinued,
updated applicable WQC, and updated listing information for impairments in the Chelsea River,
concentrations of certain parameters may not meet all permit effluent limitations without additional
treatment.
However, concentrations of certain parameters may not meet all of the Draft Permit’s effluent
limitations. As a result, this discharge may require additional treatment. This determination is based
on monitoring data collected at Outfall 002 since use of the system was discontinued, updated
applicable WQC, and updated listing information for impairments in the Chelsea River. Therefore,
EPA and MassDEP are continuing to allow the transfer of stormwater from the tank farm area of the
Terminal to the tank farm area of the Global South LLC Terminal to prevent extended storage of
stormwater in the tank farm area at the Terminal (potentially limiting the amount of petroleum
product that could be stored within the secondary containment in the event of a spill. Transfers are

Page 14 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
allowed as long as the effluent limitations, Best Management Practices, and monitoring and reporting
requirements identified in the Draft Permit for both facilities are met. In addition, EPA believes it is
acceptable to allow this transfer to take place since both tank farms store similar petroleum products
and accordingly, both facilities have similar effluent limits. However, EPA notes that the Terminal
stores and blends ethanol (EtOH) while the Global South Terminal does not. In addition, the
Terminal discharges MtBE in effluent at higher concentrations than the Global South LLC Terminal.
EPA and MassDEP have included additional effluent limitations or monitoring requirements in the
Draft Permits for the Terminal and for the Global South LLC Terminal to account for differences in
sources of pollutants and the types of material stored between the terminals. These limitations or
requirements are described in NPDES Permit No. MA0000825, and below.
6.2.5 Other Non-Stormwater Discharges
Additional non-stormwater discharges are allowed under this permit, provided the additional nonstormwater discharges meet all effluent limitations in the Draft Permit. These discharges, listed
below, are based on non-stormwater discharges allowable under EPA’s MSGP.

Massachusetts’ Water Quality Standards

Flow
From January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013, total monthly flow reported for Outfall 001
ranged from 0.136 to 5.534 million gallons (Mgal), the total monthly flow reported for Outfall 002
ranged from 0.096 to 5.334 Mgal, and the total monthly flow reported for Outfall 003 ranged from
0.03 to 0.371 Mgal. The daily maximum flow rate reported for this period ranged from 30 to 368
GPM for Outfall 001. The daily maximum flow rate reported for this period ranged from 60 to 338
GPM for Outfall 002. The daily maximum flow rate reported for this period ranged from 4.8 to 30
GPM for Outfall 003.

Page 15 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
OWSs are the typical minimum treatment technology employed by petroleum bulk storage terminals
for treatment of stormwater runoff. This device uses gravity to separate lower-density oils from
water, resulting in an oil phase above the oil/water interface and a heavier particulate phase on the
bottom of the separator. The sizing of an OWS is based upon the flow rate, density of oil to be
separated, desired percent removal of oil, and the operating temperature range. As described above,
groundwater is first treated through the separate groundwater treatment system (OWS, chemical and
physical treatment, filtration and carbon adsorption) prior to discharge via Outfall 003. The
discharges from Outfall 002 and 003 mix, then discharge to the Chelsea River through Outfall 001.
The maximum design flow rating for Outfall 002’s OWS is 830 GPM.
The 2005 Permit required estimating the flow rate at Outfall 002’s OWS and the combined flow rate
at Outfall 001. The Draft Permit has added a requirement that the flow rate is measured using a
totalizer or similar device for Outfalls 001 and 002 to better quantify the actual volume treated
through internal Outfall 002 and ultimately discharged to the Chelsea River. The 2005 Permit also
required that the Permittee notify EPA and MassDEP of any proposed changes to either the
groundwater or stormwater conveyance or treatment systems that could cause the maximum design
flow rate through the treatment system to be exceeded. To ensure that the flow through the OWS be
maintained at or below the maximum design flow rate, such that the oil and/or particulate phases
potentially present in the stormwater treatment system are not entrained to the waterway, the Draft
Permit maintains the daily maximum flow rate limit of 830 GPM for Outfall 002, the maximum flow
rate of the system. The Draft Permit also maintains the requirement for reporting of total flow.
Additionally, the Draft Permit requires reporting the total number of discharge events that occur each
month, in order to better characterize the frequency of discharges from the Terminal.
The 2005 Permit included a daily maximum limit of 75 GPM at Outfall 003 and required monitoring
of the flow rate using a totalizer or similar device. The flow rate limit was based on the combined
treatment capacity of the temporary groundwater treatment system and the permanent groundwater
treatment system in development at the time of the 2005 Permit issuance. Only the permanent
groundwater remediation system remains in use. As a result, the Draft Permit has lowered the daily
maximum flow rate limit at Outfall 003 to 50 GPM, the maximum design flow capacity of the
treatment system. The Draft Permit continues to require reporting total flow. As a result of this
change, the Draft Permit has lowered the daily maximum flow rate limit for Outfall 001 to 880 GPM,
based on the sum of design flow capacity for the treatment systems for each internal outfall provided
by the Permittee.
The 2005 permit required effluent sampling during certain sized precipitation events. However,
effluent discharged from the stormwater treatment system does not necessarily correlate to specific
rainfall events due to storage of stormwater and retention time in secondary containment. In addition,
samples collected only in association with a qualifying rainfall event may not provide data
representative of discharges from the Terminal since the effluent includes non-stormwater discharges.
As a result, the Draft Permit requires effluent sampling during periods of discharge from the
stormwater treatment system and not necessarily during periods associated with a specific
precipitation event. The Permittee must document the measures and methods used to control flow

Page 16 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
through both the stormwater and groundwater treatment systems in its Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) (see requirements below).
7.2

Conventional Pollutants

7.2.1 pH
The 2005 Permit required that the pH of the effluent must be no less than 6.5 standard units (SU), and
no greater than 8.5 SU for Outfalls 002 and 003. From January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013,
pH levels have ranged from 6.5 SU to 8.3 SU for Outfall 002 and 6.71 SU to 8.21 SU for Outfall 003.
The Massachusetts Surface WQSs, 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)3, for Class SB waters require pH to be
within the range of 6.5 to 8.5 SU and prohibit discharges that cause the in-stream pH to change more
than 0.2 SU outside of the background range. The Draft Permit maintains a pH range of 6.5 to 8.5 SU
for Outfalls 002 and 003, and specifies that the pH cannot be more than 0.2 standard units outside of
the natural background range, consistent with Massachusetts WQSs. These requirements have also
been added to Outfall 001 to meet requirements for state certification.
7.2.2 Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
Heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are readily adsorbed onto particulate
matter and the release of these compounds into the environment can be reduced by regulating the
amount of suspended solids discharged. The 2005 Permit included a daily maximum effluent limit of
100 mg/L and a monthly average effluent limit of 30 mg/L for TSS, monitored monthly. From
January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013, maximum daily TSS levels have ranged from below
laboratory practical quantitation limits (PQLs) to 72 mg/L at Outfall 002 and from below PQLs to 9
mg/L at Outfall 003.
In establishing the technology-based limits in the 2005 permit, EPA considered similar facilities and
the Terminal’s use of an OWS. In the technology guidelines promulgated at 40 CFR Part 423 for the
Steam Electric Power Point Source Category, the storage of fuel oil at steam electric facilities at the
time the technology guidelines were promulgated was similar to the storage of petroleum products at
bulk stations and terminals. In developing effluent limits for the Steam Electric Power Point Source
Category, EPA identified TSS as a potential pollutant due to the drainage associated with equipment
containing fuel oil and/or the leakage associated with the storage of oil. 8 EPA then considered the
level of treatment that could be technologically achieved for TSS using an OWS and set
corresponding limits in the guidelines (see 40 CFR §423.12 (b)(3)). In reviewing the technologybased limits for TSS for the Draft Permit, EPA determined that operations at the Terminal remain
consistent with the conditions under which the technology guidelines promulgated at 40 CFR Part
423 can be achieved. Furthermore, EPA determined that the TSS limits in the Draft Permit are similar
to technology-based limits established for other facilities in Region 1 and similar facilities in other
regions, as described in the ELG Document.
Therefore, the Draft Permit maintains the maximum daily limit of 100 mg/L, and an average monthly
limit of 30 mg/L for Outfalls 002 and 003, monitored monthly, consistent with anti-backsliding

requirements found in 40 CFR §122.44(l). Monitoring requirements for TSS have also been added to
the Draft Permit at Outfall 001 as part of the Pollutant Scan (see Part 7.4, below).
7.2.3 Oil and Grease (O&G)
The Massachusetts Surface WQSs, 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)(7), state “These waters shall be free from
oil, grease and petrochemicals that produce a visible film on the surface of the water, impart an oily
taste to the water or an oily or other undesirable taste to the edible portions of aquatic life, coat the
banks or bottom of the water course, or are deleterious or become toxic to aquatic life.” From
January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013, O&G levels have ranged from below the laboratory
PQLs to 4.1 mg/L at Outfall 002.
A concentration of 15 mg/L is recognized as the level at which many oils produce a visible sheen
and/or cause an undesirable taste in fish. 9 As described above, the Chelsea River is listed as impaired
for taste and odor. The 2005 Permit limit of 15 mg/L is based on the benchmark level from EPAHeadquarters guidance to, and as a means of establishing a categorization within, the petroleum
marketing terminals and oil production-facilities categories. 10 Maintaining O&G levels at or below
this benchmark level will demonstrate compliance with Massachusetts WQSs. Performance data from
terminals in Massachusetts and Maine continue to support that this effluent limit can be achieved
through the proper operation of a correctly-sized OWS and properly implemented best management
practices (BMPs). As described above, the Terminal applies additional treatment of the effluent using
sand filtration and carbon adsorption.
Given water quality concerns regarding taste and odor in the Chelsea River, and to meet
Massachusetts WQSs and anti-backsliding requirements found in 40 CFR §122.44(l), the Draft
Permit maintains the maximum daily limit for O&G of 15 mg/L, monitored monthly. However, this
limit has been corrected such that it applies to Outfall 001, rather than the internal Outfall 002.
Consistent with EPA’s RGP, internal outfalls that discharge groundwater remediation effluent or
hydrostatic test water are subject to limits for the hydrocarbon fraction of O&G, Total Petroleum
Hydrocarbons (TPH), described in Section 7.3.3, below.
7.3

Toxic & Non-Conventional Pollutants

7.3.1 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
Refined petroleum products contain numerous types of hydrocarbons. Individual components
partition to environmental media based on physical and chemical properties including solubility and
vapor pressure. Rather than establishing effluent limits for every compound found in petroleum
products, limits are typically established for the compounds that would be the most difficult to
remove from the environment and demonstrate the greatest degree of toxicity. Generally, the higher
the solubility of a VOC in water, the more difficult it is to remove. VOCs such as benzene, toluene,
ethyl benzene, and the three xylene compounds (i.e., total xylenes) (BTEX) are found at relatively
high concentrations in gasoline and light distillates including diesel fuel. BTEX concentrations
decrease in the heavier grades of petroleum distillate products such as fuel oils.

NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
As described in Section 3, the Chelsea River listing in the Final Massachusetts Year 2012 Integrated
List of Waters includes petroleum hydrocarbons (i.e., a class of compounds that includes BTEX) as a
pollutant requiring a TMDL. The bulk petroleum storage facilities that discharge to the Chelsea
River, including the Terminal, are explicitly noted as one of the sources of these pollutants. In
reviewing this impairment, EPA received information from MassDEP confirming that the
impairments related to this pollutant are to the Aquatic Life, Aesthetics, Primary Contact and
Secondary Contact Uses. 11 In addition, MassDEP has not determined which individual compounds in
the pollutant class, petroleum hydrocarbons, cause or contribute to the impairment. As a result, EPA
considered the petroleum hydrocarbon compounds that are more likely to be present in the effluent
based on monitoring data for the Terminal and similar facilities, and information documented in
EPA’s ELG Document for the industrial category. Further, EPA assumed the receiving water does
not have available assimilative capacity for petroleum hydrocarbons given the toxic potential of the
compounds and the impairment status of the receiving water.
EPA reviewed all appropriate criteria including the most recent National Recommended Water
Quality Criteria, quarterly monitoring results for BTEX obtained from the discharges of the Terminal
and similar facilities along the Chelsea and Mystic Rivers, 12 information relevant to the types of
petroleum products stored at the Terminal, 13 and available ambient monitoring data. 14 These data
show that concentrations of BTEX and other petroleum hydrocarbons are typical in the discharges
that contribute to Outfall 001 and may be present in surface water and/or sediment in the Chelsea
River. EPA also reviewed the Massachusetts Waste Site/Reportable Releases Lookup for the
Terminal to determine sources of VOCs. 15 Release Tracking Number (RTN) listings indicate that 59
reportable conditions have been documented at the Terminal since 1997. RTN listings indicate 10
reportable conditions since the 2005 Permit was issued are related to gasoline. Gasoline contains
BTEX in relatively high concentrations.
The 2005 Permit included a daily maximum effluent limit of 5 µg/L at Outfalls 002 and 003 for
benzene, and a daily maximum effluent limit of 100 µg/L at Outfall 002 and 003 for BTEX. Monthly
monitoring of toluene, ethylbenzene and total xylenes was also required. From January 1, 2009
through December 31, 2013, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and total xylenes were not detected
above the laboratory PQLs (reported at 2 µg/L or 2 parts per billion) at Outfall 003. Benzene was
detected above PQLs in 18 of 59 samples ranging from 1 µg/L to 32.2 µg/L at Outfall 002 during this
time period, above the 2005 Permit limit of 5 µg/L on three occasions. During this time period,
toluene was detected above PQLs on four occasions, ethylbenzene was detected above PQLs on two
occasions, and total xylenes were detected above PQLs on four occasions at Outfall 002. Sum of

BTEX results were reported on 17 occasions at Outfall 002 during this time period, above the 2005
Permit limit of 100 µg/L on one occasion.
In determining reasonable potential for concentrations of BTEX in the effluent to cause or contribute
to an excursion above WQC, EPA often uses projected concentrations based on available effluent
data in a steady state mixing equation. However, the 95th and 99th percentile projected effluent
concentrations could not be determined given the absence of effluent data for the previous five years
for Outfall 001. Where effluent data contains a high proportion of non-detect values, current
scientific literature and technical guidance 16 does not recommend statistical analysis as the
uncertainty in the effluent variability and the degree of bias reduces the confidence in calculated
upper concentration limits. In the absence of effluent data, EPA’s Technical Support Document for
Water Quality Based Toxics Control (TSD) 17 provides methodology for determining whether a
pollutant has reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC using a variety
of factors and information in accordance with 40 CFR §122.44(d)(1)(ii). This may include dilution,
the type of industry, existing data on toxic pollutants, history of compliance problems and toxic
impact, and/or type of receiving water and designated use (see TSD page 50-51).
Based on the impairments to the Chelsea River, the presence of BTEX in discharges from the
Terminal that have occasionally exceeded the 2005 Permit limit(s), the types of petroleum products
stored at the Terminal that contain BTEX, and the presence of BTEX in available ambient monitoring
data, the effluent has a reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC with
respect to BTEX. A limit is necessary for the protection of human health (i.e., primary and secondary
contact) and to meet water quality standards established under Section 303 of the CWA as well as
Massachusetts’ WQSs (e.g., 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e)).
Further, EPA has selected benzene as the indicator parameter for BTEX. Benzene was selected
because of the BTEX compounds, benzene has the highest solubility, is one of the most toxic
constituents, and is found at relatively high concentrations in the light distillates. The concentration
of benzene in gasoline is approximately 20,000 parts per million. 18 The concentration in diesel fuel,
although several orders of magnitude smaller than that found in gasoline, is still environmentally
significant. The average percent by weight of benzene in diesel fuel is approximately 0.03 percent
which is equivalent to a concentration of benzene of approximately 300 parts per million. This value
exceeds the EPA “organism only” human health WQC for benzene, 51 µg/L (or 51 parts per
billion). 19 As a result, benzene is considered one of the most important limiting parameters found in
gasoline and light distillates. Benzene is also used as an indicator parameter for regulatory and
characterization purposes of stormwater that is exposed to light distillate products.

NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
Therefore, the Draft Permit establishes a WQBEL for benzene of 51 μg/L at Outfall 001, monitored
monthly. Because the limit for benzene at Outfall 001 is based on the “organism only” human health
WQC, the limit is expressed in the Draft Permit as a monthly average limit in accordance with
recommendations in EPA’s TSD, given the exposure expected over a lifetime. The Draft Permit
requires monitoring, without limits for the daily maximum concentration. The 2005 Permit limitation
for benzene at Outfalls 002 and 003, 5 µg/L, is a TBEL based on the type of treatment applied to the
effluent, typically regulated through EPA’s RGP for Category I, Subcategory A – Gasoline Only
Sites. The 2005 Permit also included a limit of 100 µg/L for BTEX (the sum of benzene, toluene,
ethylbenzene and total xylenes) at Outfall 002 and 003 consistent with EPA’s RGP.
As described above, the Permittee has requested relaxation of this effluent limitation given the
removal of the carbon component of the stormwater treatment system. Given the impairments to the
Chelsea River and petroleum hydrocarbons identified as a pollutant contributing to these
impairments, relaxation of the limitation at Outfall 002 for benzene and BTEX does need meet the
requirements of anti-backsliding. In addition, while this TBEL is more stringent than what would
typically apply at Outfall 002 under the RGP for hydrostatic test water (50 µg/L) or the WQBEL that
applies to outfalls discharging directly to the Chelsea River (51 µg/L), the Terminal has demonstrated
an ability to meet this limitation approximately 95% of the time, even after removal of the carbon
component of the stormwater treatment system. EPA maintains the benzene and BTEX TBELs of 5
μg/L and 100 μg/L, respectively at Outfalls 002 and 003 based on performance data from the
Terminal and to meet Massachusetts WQSs and anti-backsliding requirements found in 40 CFR
§122.44(l). These limits are expressed in the Draft Permit as a daily maximum limit.
To confirm that the use of benzene as an indicator parameter for BTEX is sufficient to meet WQSs,
the Draft Permit also includes monitoring for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and total xylenes once
per year for both the effluent at Outfall 001 and the receiving water. If monitoring data for these
compounds indicate any are present at concentrations that may cause or contribute to an impairment
in the Chelsea River or that indicate benzene is insufficient as an indicator parameter, the Draft
Permit includes a reopener clause in Part I.E.
In addition, the Draft Permit requires that the quantitative methodology used for BTEX analysis must
achieve the minimum level for analysis (“ML”) less than or equal to 2 µg/L. The ML is not the
minimum level of detection, but rather the lowest level at which the test equipment produces a
recognizable signal and acceptable calibration point for an analyte, representative of the lowest
concentration at which an analyte can be measured with a known level of confidence. Sample results
for an individual compound that is at or below the ML should be reported according to the latest EPA
Region 1 NPDES Permit Program Instructions for the Discharge Monitoring Report Forms (DMRs).
The Permittee is also required to report the PQL for analysis for each compound using a data qualifier
in the instance an analyte is not detected above the PQL.
It is important to note that MassDEP’s alternative methods for analysis known as the Volatile
Petroleum Hydrocarbon (VPH) and Extractable Petroleum Hydrocarbon (EPH) methods, which are
required by MassDEP for measuring petroleum hydrocarbons at sites being cleaned up under the
MCP, are not approved under 40 CFR Part 136. EPA does not currently have a means to evaluate
carbon range data supplied under these methods nor are the data comparable when evaluating

Page 21 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
compliance with chemical specific numerical limits for toxics related to specific water quality criteria
developed for specific pollutants in NPDES permits. These methods may not be used for sampling
required in the Draft Permit.
7.3.2 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)
PAHs are a group of organic compounds that form through the incomplete combustion of
hydrocarbons and are present in petroleum derivatives and residuals. Discharge of these products can
introduce PAHs into surface water where they may volatilize, photolyze, oxidize, biodegrade, bind to
suspended particles or sediments, or accumulate in aquatic organisms (with bioconcentration factors
often in the 10-10,000 range). In soils, PAHs may also undergo degradation, accumulation in plants,
or transport via groundwater. In an estuarine environment such as the Chelsea River, volatilization
and adsorption to suspended sediments with subsequent deposition are the primary removal processes
for medium and high molecular weight PAHs. Several PAHs are well known animal carcinogens,
while others can enhance the response of the carcinogenic PAHs.
There are 16 PAH compounds identified as priority pollutants under the CWA (see Appendix A to 40
CFR Part 423). Group I PAHs are comprised of seven known animal carcinogens. They are:
benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene,
dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene. Group II PAHs are comprised of nine priority
pollutant PAHs which are not considered carcinogens, but which can enhance or inhibit the response
of the carcinogenic PAHs. They are: acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene,
benzo(g,h,i)perylene, fluoranthene, fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene.
As described above, Chelsea River is impaired for the Aquatic Life, Aesthetics, Primary Contact and
Secondary Contact Uses because of petroleum hydrocarbons. The bulk petroleum storage facilities
that discharge to the Chelsea River, including the Terminal, are explicitly noted as one of the sources
of these pollutants. Therefore, EPA followed the same approach used in evaluating BTEX to evaluate
PAHs. As referenced above, EPA reviewed all appropriate criteria including the most recent National
Recommended Water Quality Criteria, quarterly monitoring results for PAHs obtained from the
discharges of the Terminal and similar facilities along the Chelsea River, information relevant to the
types of petroleum products stored at the Terminal, 20 and available ambient monitoring data. These
data show that concentrations of PAHs and other petroleum hydrocarbons are occasionally present in
the effluent and may be present in surface water and/or sediment in the Chelsea River. In addition,
the PQL for PAH analysis in available data for surface water and effluent is typically two to three
times the WQC for Group I PAHs. EPA also reviewed the Massachusetts Waste Site/Reportable
Releases Lookup for the Terminal to determine possible sources of PAHs. RTN listings indicate that
one reportable condition present at the Terminal since 2005 is related to elevated concentrations of
petroleum hydrocarbon fractions in soil. Historic releases also involved diesel and/or No. 2 fuel oil.
The 2005 Permit included quarterly monitoring, without limits for the Group I PAHs as listed below
at Outfall 002:

The 2005 Permit also included limits at 20 µg/L for naphthalene at Outfalls 002 and 003.
From January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013, for Outfall 002, individual Group I PAH
compounds were not detected above the laboratory PQLs. Naphthalene was detected on four
occasions and 10 occasions during this period at Outfalls 002 and 003, respectively. Concentrations
of naphthalene did not exceed the permit limits.
Similar to the data usability issues identified for BTEX, in determining reasonable potential for
concentrations of PAHs in the effluent to cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC, EPA was
unable to use the 95th and 99th percentile projected effluent concentrations given the insufficiency of
the effluent data for the previous five years (i.e., a high proportion of non-detect values). As noted
above, the PQL for analysis was typically three times the WQC for Group I PAHs. These non-detect
data are not representative of concentrations of PAHs in the effluent when calculating reasonable
potential, since PAHs may be present above the WQC but below the PQL. EPA cannot assume PAHs
are not present above WQC where a sample is non-detect but the PQL is insufficient.
Therefore, EPA also followed guidance in the TSD for determining whether a pollutant has
reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC using a variety of factors and
information in accordance with 40 CFR §122.44(d)(1)(ii). Based on the impairment and cause of
impairment in the Chelsea River, the type of petroleum products stored at the Terminal that contain
PAHs, the levels of PAHs that have been documented in effluent, soil and/or groundwater at the
Terminal and in the Chelsea River, the presence of PAHs in groundwater remediation effluent, the
potential health concerns associated with PAHs, and absent an approved mixing zone in accordance
with 314 CMR 4.03(2), the effluent has a reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion
above WQC with respect to PAHs. A limit is required for the protection of human health (i.e.,
primary and secondary contact) and to meet water quality standards established under Section 303 of
the CWA as well as Massachusetts’ WQSs (e.g., 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e)).
Further, EPA has selected to limit one Group I PAH, benzo(a)pyrene, and one Group II PAH,
naphthalene, as the indicator parameters for PAHs at Outfall 001. While the distillation process
removes a greater proportion of Group I PAHs by weight, these compounds can still be present in
low concentrations, particularly benzo(a)pyrene. Benzo(a)pyrene has been used extensively as a
model carcinogen and as a positive control in a variety of risk assessment tests. EPA has designated
this compound as a known animal carcinogen and probable human carcinogen. Relative to the other
Group I PAHs, it is strongly carcinogenic. Of Group II PAHs, naphthalene, like benzo(a)pyrene
poses high calculable risk relative to other PAHs. It is included as a priority pollutant under the CWA
and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. In middle and heavy distillates, naphthalene is one
of the most commonly found compounds, present in diesel fuel and No. 2 fuel oil at up to

Page 23 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
approximately 0.8 and 0.4 percent by weight, respectively. 21 Naphthalene is only slightly soluble in
water, but is highly soluble in benzene and other solvents.
Therefore, the Draft Permit establishes an effluent limit of 0.018 μg/L for benzo(a)pyrene and 100
µg/L for naphthalene at Outfall 001 to ensure compliance with Massachusetts WQSs. The limit for
benzo(a)pyrene is based on the “organism only” human health WQC, selected because of the uses
designated for Class SB waters. Naphthalene does not currently have applicable aquatic life or human
health WQC. Therefore, the limit for naphthalene at Outfall 001 is based on EPA’s lifetime health
advisory value for naphthalene, 100 µg/L. The limits are expressed in the Draft Permit as monthly
average limits, established in accordance with recommendations in EPA’s TSD, given the exposure
expected over a lifetime. The Draft Permit requires monitoring, without limits for the daily maximum
concentrations. Through implementation of the BAT/BCT for stormwater associated with industrial
activity, the SWPPP, and with proper operation and maintenance of the Terminal’s stormwater and
groundwater treatment systems, concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene in discharges
from the Terminal are expected to consistently meet the effluent limitations. The establishment of
PAH limits ensures compliance with Massachusetts WQSs. Compliance with these limits for the
indicator PAHs for Group I and Group II PAHs at Outfall 001 will demonstrate compliance with
Massachusetts’ WQSs for all PAHs.
The Draft Permit also includes TBELs for individual Group I PAHs, the sum of Group I PAHs, the
sum of Group II PAHs and maintains the TBEL for naphthalene at Outfall 003, selected given the
type of discharges from the Terminal, and the type of treatment applied to the effluent consistent with
EPA’s RGP Appendix III for Category I, Subcategory A – Gasoline Only Sites, Category I, and
Subcategory B – Fuel Oil and Other Oils Sites.
As described above, the Permittee has requested relaxation of effluent limitations and requirements
for PAHs given the removal of the carbon component of the stormwater treatment system. Given the
impairments to the Chelsea River and petroleum hydrocarbons having been identified as a pollutant
contributing to these impairments, relaxation of the limitation at Outfall 002 for naphthalene does not
meet the requirements of anti-backsliding. In addition, while this TBEL is more stringent than the
WQBEL that applies to outfalls discharging directly to the Chelsea River (100 µg/L), the Terminal
has demonstrated an ability to consistently meet this limitation, even after removal of the carbon
component of the stormwater treatment system. EPA maintains the naphthalene TBEL of 20 μg/L at
Outfalls 002 based on performance data from the Terminal and to meet Massachusetts WQSs and
anti-backsliding requirements found in 40 CFR §122.44(l). These limits are expressed in the Draft
Permit as a daily maximum limit. With regard to requirements for PAHs at Outfall 002, because
WQBELs and additional monitoring, described below, have been added to Outfall 001 downstream
of Outfall 002, duplicative monitoring for Group I PAHs at Outfall 002 has been removed. No
effluent limits have been changed.
To confirm that the use of benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene as indicator parameters for PAHs is
sufficient to meet WQSs, and to better quantify the variability of the pollutants in the effluent, the
Draft Permit has set the frequency of monitoring for these pollutants to monthly. To further support

Page 24 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
the use of benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene as the indicator parameters, the Draft Permit also includes
monitoring for the seven Group I PAHs (listed above) and nine Group II PAHs (listed below) once
per year for both the effluent and the receiving water:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Acenaphthene
Acenaphthylene
Anthracene
Benzo(g,h,i)perylene
Fluoranthene
Fluorene
Naphthalene (analytical method requirements also established)
Phenanthrene
Pyrene

Should monitoring data indicate the persistence of PAHs in concentrations that may cause or
contribute to an excursion above water quality criteria, the permit may be modified, reissued or
revoked pursuant to 40 CFR §122.62. In the event monitoring data indicate benzo(a)pyrene and/or
naphthalene are insufficient as indicator parameters for PAHs, the Draft Permit includes a reopener
clause, as required, in Part I.E.
The human health criteria for benzo(a)pyrene as expressed in nanograms per liter, is many times
lower than the current PQLs for determining PAH concentrations in aqueous solutions. Where
effluent limits have been established in NPDES permits but compliance cannot be determined using
currently approved analytical methods (e.g. if WQBELs are less than the analytical capability of the
methods), EPA has considered establishing National Quantitation Limits (NQLs) under 40 CFR Part
136. In the absence of NQLs, EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee on Detection and Quantitation
report 22 recommends setting compliance limits at the lowest concentration possible using approved
analytical methods. This report further recommends permits contain a condition that the PQL be at or
below the ML and that permits should further specify reporting requirements for results below the
ML, or above the PQL but below the ML, typically noted on a laboratory report as an “estimated
value”.
Therefore, the Draft Permit requires that the quantitative methodology used for PAH analysis must
achieve the ML of ≤0.1 µg/L for each Group I PAH compound and ≤10 µg/L for each Group II PAH
compound. The ML will serve as the compliance level for benzo(a)pyrene. These MLs are based on
those listed in Appendix VI of EPA’s Remediation General Permit and similar facilities in the region.
This approach is also consistent with EPA’s TSD, page 111, which recommends, “the compliance
level be defined in the permit as the minimum level (ML).” The Permittee may use any approved
analytical method in CFR Part 136 for which the PQL is at or below the ML. As described in 7.3.1
above, MassDEP’s VPH and/or EPH methods may not be used for sampling required in the Draft
Permit.

Naphthalene is commonly measured using test methods for both VOCs and semi-volatile organic
compounds (SVOCs). Therefore, the Draft Permit also maintains the requirement that naphthalene be
monitored using both SVOC and VOC analytical methods. The other 15 priority pollutant PAHs are
only analyzed using SVOC methods. Any non-detect or estimated results for an individual compound
should be reported according to the latest EPA Region 1 NPDES Permit Program Instructions for the
Discharge Monitoring Report Forms (DMRs). The Permittee is also required to report the PQL for
analysis for each compound using a data qualifier in the instance an analyte is not detected above the
PQL. These values may be reduced by modification pursuant to 40 CFR §122.62 as more sensitive
tests become available or are approved by EPA and MassDEP.
7.3.3 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons
O&G has been the primary petroleum related parameter used in many of EPA’s individual NPDES
permits and is a common parameter in many of EPA’s promulgated industrial effluent guidelines. A
total O&G analysis includes petroleum-related O&G but may also capture other non-petroleum fats
and greases in the result. Similarly, due to the sheer number of chemicals contained in refined
petroleum products, measurement of all of the component chemicals is not practical, cost effective, or
needed for adequate attainment of water quality standards. TPH measures the total concentration of
all petroleum related hydrocarbons within a specified carbon range and is often applied to wastewater
generated during remediation activities. The petroleum related hydrocarbons included within this
analysis range from compounds with six carbon atoms (C 6 ) to compounds with 25 carbon atoms
(C 25 ). The use of TPH testing is a common approach implemented by regulatory agencies in the
United States to establish target cleanup levels for contaminated soil or water. 23 An aggregate
measurement of the hydrocarbon compounds can also serve as an indicator of overall relative
pollutant concentration and as an indicator for assessing water quality impacts.
Therefore, the hydrocarbon fraction of the O&G parameter, or TPH, was included in the 2005 Permit
with a maximum daily limit of 5 mg/L at Outfalls 002 and 003. EPA established this TBEL based
upon performance information for the type of treatment the Terminal applies to discharges of
groundwater or hydrostatic test water consistent with EPA’s RGP. From January 1, 2009 through
December 31, 2013, TPH ranged from below the laboratory PQLs to 1.6 µg/L at Outfall 002 and
below PQLs to 1.76 µg/L at Outfall 003. EPA reviewed the Massachusetts Waste Site/Reportable
Releases Lookup 24 for the Terminal to determine if continuing sources of TPH are present in soil or
groundwater. RTN listings indicate that 19 reportable conditions have been reported since the 2005
Permit was issued. One of these conditions was elevated concentrations of TPH in soil.
The hydrocarbon makeup in the environment can change after the product has been released through
leaks, spills, or other releases due to processes including volatilization, biodegradation, and sorption.
This process occurs over a period of many years in soil and groundwater, sometimes referred to as
“weathering”. As described above, the Permittee has requested relaxation of effluent limitations and
requirements for PAHs given the removal of the carbon component of the stormwater treatment
system. Given the impairments to the Chelsea River and petroleum hydrocarbons having been
identified as a pollutant contributing to these impairments, relaxation of the limitation at Outfall 002

NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
for TPH does need meet the requirements of anti-backsliding. Based on the recent indication of TPH
in soil, which may come into contact with groundwater and/or stormwater at the Terminal, the Draft
Permit maintains the maximum daily limit of 5 mg/L at Outfalls 002 and 003. The Permittee is
required to monitor monthly. Individual analytes of TPH, such as BTEX and PAHs, which are also
parameters in the Draft Permit, provide additional chemical specific controls on the discharge.
There are several EPA approved methods (and modifications allowed) which may be used to quantify
TPH such as Modified Method 8100 and Method 1664. EPA Method 1664 replaced EPA Method
418.1 to eliminate the use of Freon. As described in 7.3.1 above, MassDEP’s VPH and/or EPH
methods may not be used for sampling required in the Draft Permit.
7.3.4 Oxygenates
Many chemical compounds have been added to petroleum fuels to enhance their performance. Due to
the phase-out of leaded gasoline in the early 1980's, several alcohols and ethers began to replace
tetraethyl lead as an anti-knock and octane boosting additive. Since 1992, higher concentrations of
gasoline “oxygenates,” such as MtBE and EtOH have been used to improve the combustion of fuel in
certain air pollution “non-attainment” areas of the country including New England.
MtBE
MtBE is a synthetic compound used as a replacement for lead containing compounds in fuels. MtBE
was typically added in concentrations less than 1 percent by volume in regular gasoline, and 2-9
percent by volume in premium gasoline. When the 1990 Clean Air Act requirements for cleaner
burning fuels took effect (which required additional oxygen content), MtBE concentrations increased
to 11-15% by volume. Due to its small molecular size and solubility in water, MtBE moves rapidly
into the groundwater, faster than many other constituents of gasoline. Because of these physical
properties, MtBE has been detected in significant concentrations in groundwater due to tank leaks or
other releases of petroleum fuels.
Although MtBE is no longer used at the Terminal, MtBE blended gasoline was stored on site until
EtOH came into use. Historic groundwater samples at the Terminal have indicated up to 10,000 μg/L
of MtBE. As a result, the 2005 Permit included a technology-based effluent limit for MtBE at
Outfalls 002 and 003 of 70 μg/L. This limit was based on a properly designed and maintained
treatment system, consistent with EPA’s RGP. From January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013,
concentrations ranged from below the PQL to 34.2 µg/L at Outfall 002 and from below the PQL to
81.4 µg/L at Outfall 003. Concentrations of MtBE exceeded the 2005 Permit limit at Outfall 003 on
two occasions. Concentrations of MtBE have not been measured at Outfall 001.
In reviewing appropriate criteria for MtBE, EPA noted that this compound is not currently listed as a
priority pollutant by EPA and as such has neither aquatic nor human health standards developed
under EPA’s water quality programs. However, EPA has issued lifetime health advisories for MtBE
in drinking water based primarily on taste and odor thresholds, also considered protective of human
health. An advisory from 1996 established an MtBE concentration level of 70 µg/L water as a
threshold value for taste and odor. The current advisory establishes a concentration of 20 to 40 µg/L
of MtBE since MtBE has an odor threshold at 20 µg/L, and a taste threshold at 40 µg/L.

Page 27 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
To meet Massachusetts’ narrative criteria found at 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b), the Draft Permit prohibits
discharges that impart taste and odor, among other properties, which would cause the receiving water
to be unsuitable for its designated uses. To determine if discharges of MtBE have reasonable
potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC, EPA used daily maximum MtBE data
from the effluent data from April 2010 to 2013 for Outfall 002 (i.e., after discontinued use of the
carbon component of the stormwater treatment system) and 2009 through 2013 for Outfall 003 to
calculate projected effluent concentrations. 25 EPA projected the maximum effluent concentration by
calculating the 99th percentile measurement of the effluent data for each outfall. EPA calculated these
projections without dilution in the receiving water.
MtBE:

99th percentile concentration for Outfall 002 = 25.3 µg/L
99th percentile concentration for Outfall 003 = 116.7 µg/L

While data were unavailable for Outfall 001, EPA considered data from internal Outfalls 002 and 003
representative because no additional treatment is applied to the effluent once effluent from Outfall
002 and 003 comingle. However, EPA adjusted projected effluent concentrations to the average
percent flow contribution to Outfall 001 from each internal outfall.
Outfall 002:
Outfall 003:

Average percent of Total Flow (2009-2013) = 0.835
Average percent of Total Flow (2009-2013) = 0.183

Therefore, EPA multiplied the projected maximum effluent concentration by the average percent of
total flow from each outfall. These adjusted projections are then compared to the applicable WQC, 20
µg/L, to determine if the combined effluent has reasonable to potential to cause or contribute to an
excursion above WQC.
MtBE:

Outfall 002 = 25.3 µg/L * 0.8345 = 21.1 µg/L
21.1 µg/L > 20 µg/L = reasonable potential
Outfall 003 = 116.7 µg/L * 0.183 = 21.3 µg/L
21.3 µg/L > 20 µg/L = reasonable potential

Therefore, based on the designated uses for the Chelsea River, impairments to the designated uses
(e.g., taste and odor), the relative toxicity of MtBE, and the persistence of MtBE in discharges at the
Terminal at concentrations that have reasonable potential to exceed the odor advisory threshold when
discharged via Outfall 001. Therefore, the Draft Permit establishes a WQBEL for MtBE for Outfall
001. The permit limit of 20 µg/L is the lower EPA advisory threshold for taste and odor effects. Since
this is a human health lifetime health advisory, the limit has been established as a monthly average.
The Draft Permit requires monitoring, without limits for the daily maximum concentration. The Draft
Permit also maintains the TBEL for MtBE at Outfall 002 to meet the requirements of antibacksliding. The TBEL for Outfall 003 has been revised to be consistent with EPA’s RGP, which
established a TBEL for MtBE at 20 µg/L for discharges of groundwater remediation effluent at sites
that use a treatment technology such as carbon.
25

The procedure used to obtain the 95th and 99th percentile projections is the standard method described in EPA’s
Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control: EPA/505/2-90-001, 1991 when the sample size is
greater than or equal to 10 and the dataset includes non-detect values.

Page 28 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
EtOH
EtOH is a fuel oxygenate additive blended with gasoline to replace the more toxic additive MtBE and
has been stored at the Terminal since April 2005. The use of EtOH as a fuel additive could lead to
exposures from water that has been contaminated with ethanol from leaking storage facilities or
accidental spills. EtOH is a clear, colorless liquid, miscible with water and many organic solvents.
When released into surface water, it will volatilize or biodegrade rapidly and is not expected to
adsorb to sediment or bioaccumulate in fish. However, large releases of ethanol may deplete
dissolved oxygen concentrations resulting in levels unable to support aquatic life. EtOH in
groundwater will degrade more slowly, particularly under conditions where microbial activity and
oxygen levels in soil have already been impacted by releases of petroleum hydrocarbons. EtOH is
known to slow the degradation in BTEX groundwater plumes, which can potentially result in higher
concentrations of BTEX retained for longer periods or a plume size of longer distance from the origin
point.
EPA has not promulgated ELGs for EtOH at petroleum storage facilities although ELGs exist for
EtOH as a non-conventional pollutant in the pharmaceutical manufacturing point source category (40
CFR §439). EPA has also not established human health or aquatic life WQC for EtOH. EtOH has
relatively low toxicity (e.g., EtOH is not a toxic priority pollutant and ecotoxicity information
available in Material Safety Data Sheets indicate lethal effects to aquatic life occur at concentrations
between approximately 11,000 mg/L to 34,000 mg/L). From January 1, 2009 through December 31,
2013, concentrations of EtOH ranged from below the laboratory PQLs to 1,230 µg/L at Outfall 002.
Given the short residence time expected in the environment and a lack of practical technologies to
remove EtOH from stormwater, EPA is not applying numeric effluent limitations in the Draft Permit.
However, EPA has included technology-based BMPs in the SWPPP, such as spill control BMPs, to
address the potential discharge of ethanol and petroleum-related pollutants. As previously stated, no
WQC have been developed or approved by EPA.
However, EPA reviewed the available benchmark monitoring levels for EtOH in determining the
monitoring requirements for EtOH. The New England Interstate Water Pollution Control
Commission utilized guidance included in EPA’s Final Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes
System (1995), referred to as Tier II procedures, to calculate conservative water quality benchmark
concentrations for EtOH in the absence of sufficient data to derive WQC. 26 These represent the
concentrations at which EtOH would be expected to deplete dissolved oxygen levels below those
necessary to sustain aquatic life or cause acute and chronic effects, conditions would violate
Massachusetts WQSs. These levels are 13 mg/L for depletion of in stream dissolved oxygen in a
large river (most conservative), and 564 mg/L and 63 mg/L for acute and chronic effect
concentrations, respectively. To continue evaluation of the effects from long term use of EtOH as a
fuel additive, and to ensure EtOH is not entrained to the Chelsea River from the Terminal, the Draft
Permit maintains monitoring of EtOH for Outfall 002 and has added a monitoring requirement for
Outfall 001. The Draft Permit also specifies that the PQL for analysis of EtOH achieve 0.4 mg/L. The
Draft Permit also includes a non-numeric technology-based limitation specific to EtOH in the
Terminal’s SWPPP requirement.

7.4
Pollutant Scan
The industrial property on which the Global Terminal operates has been utilized for industrial fuel
storage since 1947. Historical impacts related to operations at the Terminal site have been
documented and addressed by the MCP since 1997. The effluent contains a small volume of
groundwater remediation effluent. In addition, stormwater at the Terminal has the potential to come
into contact with materials stored at the Terminal or contamination in soil or groundwater from
activities that took place at the Terminal historically or continue to take place currently. The Terminal
also periodically discharges hydrostatic test water.
In EPA’s evaluation of historical releases at the Terminal, RTN listings indicate that at least 59
reportable conditions have been documented at the Terminal since 1997, 19 of which have occurred
since the 2005 Permit was issued. These reportable conditions have been related to gasoline, #2 fuel
oil, diesel, kerosene, and elevated concentrations of BTEX, PAHs, and TPH in soil and groundwater.
Documentation required for a portion of the remediation occurring at the Terminal further indicates
the presence of waste oil in soil and/or groundwater. Many of the pollutants associated with these
releases are listed as priority pollutants in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 423 or are non-conventional
pollutants that have not otherwise been addressed in the Draft Permit.
Section 308 of the Clean Water Act allows EPA to require the Permittee to report information
necessary for the establishment of appropriate permit limits and conditions or monitoring
requirements. To protect the Chelsea River and the integrity of the stormwater, the Draft Permit
includes the requirement to conduct annual sampling at Outfall 001 for a portion of the 126 EPA
Priority Pollutants and selected non-conventional pollutants related to impairments in the Chelsea
River, as listed below.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

BTEX: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, total xylenes
Group I PAHs: benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene,
benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene,
indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene
Group II PAHs: acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene,
benzo(g,h,i)perylene, fluoranthene, fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene
Metals: chromium, iron
Phenol
tert-butyl alcohol
Ammonia
Fecal coliform

In addition, the Draft Permit requires testing for BTEX, Group I PAHs and Group II PAHs as listed
above for the receiving water once per year. The effluent and ambient testing of petroleum
hydrocarbons is further required to confirm that the effluent meets WQSs through limitation of an
indicator pollutant in accordance with 40 CFR §122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C).
These pollutants were selected on a site-specific basis, given the types of discharges at the Terminal,
impairments in the Chelsea River, and pollutants that have the potential to comingle with effluent

Page 30 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
directly or through contact with contaminated groundwater or soil given the operational and/or
release history. The partial list of pollutants is derived primarily from requirements for these
pollutants described in EPA’s ELG Document, which lists pollutants typically found at similar
facilities in similar types of discharges, which are limited or monitored by regulatory agencies
throughout the United States (e.g., phenol). EPA also reviewed Category I of Appendix III of the
RGP, Sub-Category A – Gasoline Only Sites, Category I, Sub-Category B – Fuel Oils and Other Oil
Sites and Category IV, Sub-Category C – Hydrostatic Testing of Pipelines and Tanks, and additional
monitoring requirements in EPA’s MSGP for discharges to an impaired water.
The Draft Permit contains limitations or requirements for certain pollutants noted above, namely,
BTEX, and PAHs, as described in Sections 7.3.1, and 7.3.2, respectively. Monitoring results from the
testing of these parameters where required at least annually in the Draft Permit, can be used to satisfy
the requirements for the annual pollutant scan, as long as the timing of sampling coincides with the
sampling for other parameters of the pollutant scan. The other parameters, chromium, iron, phenol,
tert-butyl alcohol, ammonia, total suspended solids and fecal coliform, are further described below.
The permit may be reopened to include chemical specific limitations for any of the pollutants
described if the sampling data demonstrates that the effluent has a reasonable potential to cause or
contribute to an excursion above WQC (see 40 CFR §122.44(d)(1)(iii)).
7.4.1 Chromium
Many types of metals occur in ground and surface waters around New England. Concentrations of
metals vary widely depending on the geology and types of activities that have occurred at an
industrial site. Certain metals like copper, lead, and zinc can be toxic to aquatic life, and may
bioaccumulate in plants and animal species. Sources of metals in discharges from the Terminal may
include petroleum products, which contain de minimis quantities of metals by weight, depending
upon the type of fuel. Additional sources potentially include the municipal water supply, process
piping, and historical releases. The Draft Permit requires the Permittee test for a limited number of
metals once per year at Outfall 001 as part of the WET testing requirements (see below). The list of
metals required for WET testing was revised pursuant to a new testing protocol in 2012 such that
testing for chromium was removed.
In many instances, metals like chromium build up to toxic concentrations through small releases that
occur repeatedly over time, resulting in industrial contamination. Chromium has been found in
groundwater at remediation and construction de-watering sites in Region 1, particularly in urban
areas that have had long histories of industrial and municipal activity. While chromium is actually
required by the human body in small amounts, it can also be toxic in larger doses. Water organisms
are often more sensitive than humans to metals. Because monitoring data are not available for
chromium for discharges from the Terminal, EPA has included monitoring requirements to ensure the
metal is not present in quantities that could cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC. The
Draft Permit requires that total recoverable chromium be analyzed and specifies an ML for analysis.
EPA is required by 40 CFR Section 122.45(c) to express NPDES permit limitations as “total
recoverable metal”. See EPA’s National Recommended Water Quality Criteria (822-R-02-047),
November 2002, for applicable conversion factors.

Page 31 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
7.4.2 Iron
Given the impairment in the Chelsea River for turbidity and taste and odor, EPA considered metals
known to cause an organoleptic effect (i.e., taste and odor), which are potentially present at the
Terminal, but are not currently monitored. Of those metals listed in EPA’s National Recommended
Water Quality Criteria, EPA has noted high levels of naturally occurring iron in groundwater in New
England, such as that discharged from Outfall 003. Iron in groundwater (ferrous Fe+2) will oxidize to
insoluble ferric hydroxide (Fe+3) upon mixing and exposure to air. As Fe+3, it can foul treatment
systems, cause growth of iron bacteria in systems, and may discolor the effluent or cause localized
sediment deposits in stormwater collection infrastructure or the receiving waters. Excessive amounts
may cause or contribute to violations of WQSs including those related to color, turbidity, solids, and
odor, as well as fouling of the discharge treatment systems. Therefore, the Draft Permit has included
iron in the pollutant scan at Outfall 001, to determine if iron is present in discharges of groundwater
from the site in quantities that violate WQSs. The Draft Permit requires that total recoverable iron be
analyzed and specifies an ML for analysis.
7.4.3 Phenol
Phenol and phenolic compounds are widely used chemical intermediates and occur in the
environment as a result of manufacturing, use of products containing phenols, from combustion
sources, coal gas, and natural decay of organic matter. Phenol may also be present in de minimis
quantities in gasoline, diesel and kerosene. Phenol and a number of other compounds including nitrophenols and chlorinated phenols are listed as priority pollutants that have been evaluated for the
establishment of water quality criteria. Phenol and a number of other phenolic compounds are
included in EPA’s WQC as having organoleptic (i.e., taste and odor) effects in water at low levels.
The threshold at which phenol has an effect on taste and odor in water is 300 µg/L.
The occurrence of phenol or phenol compounds is generally infrequent in discharges, possibly due to
rapid biodegradation of phenol in the environment. However, due to its wide use, distribution in the
environment, the types of materials stored at the Terminal, and its potential effect on taste and odor in
the Chelsea River, total phenol has been included in the requirement for the pollutant scan to ensure
the pollutant is not present in quantities that could cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC.
The Draft Permit requires that total phenol be analyzed and specifies an ML for analysis.
7.4.4 tert-Butyl Alcohol
Similar to MtBE and ethanol, tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) is an oxygenate compound that has been
added to petroleum fuels to enhance their performance. TBA, which can be present as both a fuel
additive and as a breakdown product of MtBE in the environment, is essentially miscible in water,
has a much lower Henry’s law constant (10-5) and a low Koc value. As a result, TBA is expected to
be even more difficult than MtBE to control to low concentrations.
TBA is monitored in groundwater at the Terminal in conjunction with activities required under the
MCP. In addition, monitoring data available for the Chelsea River indicate TBA has been detected in
surface water. Massachusetts established an Action Level of 1,000 µg/L for TBA and monitoring for
the compound is required for certain sites under EPA’s RGP. Therefore, TBA has been included in
the requirement for the pollutant scan to ensure the pollutant is not present in quantities that could
cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC. The Draft Permit specifies an ML for analysis.

As described above, the Chelsea River is impaired and requires a TMDL for ammonia (un-ionized).
EPA’s recommended criteria for ammonia in saltwater are based on temperature, pH and salinity in
the receiving water. Information available through the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority’s
monitoring program for sampling location 027, located near the Terminal on Chelsea River 27
indicates that from 1989 to 2011, the surface water temperature in the Chelsea River has ranged from
1.41°C to 23.6 °C, the pH has ranged from 4.51 SU to 9.5 SU and the salinity has ranged from 0.6
grams per kilogram (g/kg) (or parts per thousand (ppt)) to 33.02 g/kg(ppt). EPA utilized the median
values for temperature, pH and salinity for determination of applicable criteria, 15oC, 7.8 SU and 30
g/kg (ppt), respectively.
According to the 1989 Ambient Aquatic Life Water Quality Criteria for Ammonia (Saltwater 28), when
the receiving water temperature is 15°C (59oF), the pH of the receiving water is 7.8 SU and the
receiving water salinity is 30 g/kg, the recommended acute criterion value is 16 mg/L and the
recommended chronic criterion value is 2.4 mg/L. Ammonia has not been monitored at the Terminal.
However, one sample collected in support of the Permittee’s permit renewal application indicated the
concentration for ammonia was 3.36 mg/L.
Based on the types of discharges at the Terminal, the presence of ammonia in the effluent and the
impairment for ammonia in the Chelsea River, the Draft Permit includes a requirement for ammonia
(as N) in the pollutant scan to ensure ammonia is not present in discharges from the Terminal at
concentrations that could cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC.
7.4.6 Fecal coliform
While the Terminal does not engage in activities that would be expected to generate large sources of
bacteria, stormwater runoff can readily transport bacteria from surfaces susceptible to the waste
products of warm-blooded animals or pathogens, which attach to organic and inorganic particles.
Many bacteria can survive in freshwater and saltwater environments, posing health risk to humans
fish/shellfish, and water quality. As described above, the Chelsea River is listed in the Massachusetts
Year 2012 Integrated List of Waters as impaired for its designated uses and fecal coliform is listed as
a pollutant requiring a TMDL. The Massachusetts WQSs at 314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)4 limits fecal
coliform in Class SB waters designated for shellfishing. EPA does not currently have information
regarding bacteria in discharges from the Terminal. Therefore, the Draft Permit includes a
requirement for fecal coliform in the pollutant scan to ensure bacteria are not present in discharges
from the Terminal at concentrations that could cause or contribute to an excursion above WQSs.
Inclusion of monitoring for a pollutant for which the receiving water is impaired is consistent with
EPA’s MSGP.
7.5
Whole Effluent Toxicity
Sections 402(a)(2) and 308(a) of the CWA provide EPA and States with the authority to require
toxicity testing. Section 308 specifically describes biological monitoring methods as techniques that
may be used to carry out objectives of the CWA. Under certain State narrative WQSs, and Sections

Page 33 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
301, 303 and 402 of the CWA, EPA and the States may establish toxicity-based limits to implement
the narrative “no toxics in toxic amounts”. Massachusetts has narrative criteria in their water quality
regulations (see Massachusetts 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e)) that prohibit toxic discharges in toxic amounts.
The Draft Permit prohibits the addition of toxic materials or chemicals to the discharges and prohibits
the discharge of pollutants in amounts that would be toxic to aquatic life.
To meet Massachusetts’ narrative criteria found at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e), the Draft Permit prohibits
the discharge of pollutants in amounts that would be toxic to aquatic life. WET testing is conducted
to determine whether certain effluents, often containing potentially toxic pollutants, are discharged in
a combination that produces a toxic amount of pollutants in the receiving water. Therefore, toxicity
testing is used in conjunction with pollutant-specific control procedures to minimize the discharge of
toxic pollutants.
The regulations at 40 CFR §122.44(d)(ii) state, “When determining whether a discharge causes, has
the reasonable potential to cause, or contributes to an in-stream excursion above a narrative or
numeric criteria within a State water quality standard, the permitting authority shall use procedures
which account for existing controls on point and non-point sources of pollution...(including) the
sensitivity of the species to toxicity testing...” MassDEP in its “Implementation Policy for the Control
of Toxic Pollutants in Surface Waters” (February 23, 1990) (“Toxics Policy”) sets forth toxicity
limits according to dilution factors based on perceived risk.
Based on the impairment to aquatic life in the Chelsea River, and given the potential for synergistic
effect of several pollutants of concern for discharges from the Terminal, the Draft Permit contains
acute testing requirements for effluent and chemical analysis requirements for receiving water once
per year. The Draft Permit requires that testing be conducted for both the Mysid Shrimp
(Americamysis bahia) and Inland Silverside (Menidia beryllina). The requirements included in the
Draft Permit are consistent with the Toxics Policy for dilution in the low risk category except that the
frequency of testing normally required in the Toxics Policy has been reduced because the discharge is
intermittent and consists almost entirely of stormwater runoff.
The Permittee must collect the required receiving water sample (i.e., diluent) from the Chelsea River
at a point immediately outside of the permitted discharge’s zone of influence at a reasonably
accessible location. A receiving water control (0% effluent) must be tested once per year for the
chemical parameters in Attachment A, Marine Acute Toxicity Test Procedure and Protocol (July
2012). If toxicity is indicated, the Permittee is allowed use of alternate dilution water in accordance
with the provisions in the Draft Permit. To clarify the requirements for effluent and receiving water
for this testing, EPA has included WET parameters on the DMRs. Results of these toxicity tests will
demonstrate compliance with the Massachusetts WQSs.
7.6
Hydrostatic Testing
The tanks and/or pipe networks used for the storage and conveyance of petroleum products at the
Terminal sometimes require maintenance or repair. To ensure safe working conditions during this
maintenance work, storage tanks and/or pipe networks are rigorously cleaned (e.g., “Poly Brushed”,
“Squeegee Pigged”) and certified as being product-free. After completing maintenance work, the
vessels and/or pipe networks may be hydrostatically tested for leaks. Hydrostatic testing involves

Page 34 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
filling the vessel or pipe with fluid under pressure and monitoring pressure drops over time. If the
system maintains a constant pressure, there are no leaks. River water or potable water may be used
as a source of hydrostatic test water. Thus, hydrostatic test water discharge may contain minimal
amounts of foreign matter, trace amounts of hydrocarbons, background material found in the river or
residual chlorine. Hydrostatic testing has not occurred in the last five years.
As a precaution, the Draft Permit requires any hydrostatic test water to be monitored (as further
described below) and treated through the stormwater treatment system prior to being discharged to
the Chelsea River. In addition, the Draft Permit requires control of the flow of hydrostatic test water
to prevent exceeding the maximum design flow rate of 830 GPM at Outfall 002.
The Draft Permit requires collection of a minimum of five representative samples of the hydrostatic
test water:
For tanks, the Draft Permit requires the Permittee to take:
• one grab sample of the influent (one grab sample of the fill water during the first 10% of the
estimated fill segment time (source at intake));
• one grab sample of the tank water (at the effluent point of the tank), following testing but
before draining (in-process);
• two grab samples of the effluent (one sample of the discharge water during the first 10% of
discharge and one sample during the last 10% of discharge) before treatment through the
stormwater treatment system; and
• one grab sample of the effluent (one sample of the discharge water during the first 10% of
discharge) following treatment through the stormwater treatment system through Outfall 002
prior to mixing with discharges from Outfall 003 and discharging via Outfall 001.
For pipelines, the Draft Permit requires the Permittee to take:
• one grab sample of the influent (one grab sample of the fill water during the first 10% of the
estimated fill segment time (source at intake));
• one grab sample of the pipeline water following depressurization (in-process);
• two grab samples of the effluent (one sample of the discharge water during the first 10% of
discharge and one sample during the last 10% of discharge) before treatment through the
stormwater treatment system; and
• one grab sample of the effluent (one sample of the discharge water during the first 10% of
discharge) following treatment through the stormwater treatment system through Outfall 002
prior to mixing with discharges from Outfall 003 and discharging via Outfall 001.
All samples are required to be analyzed for the pollutants limited in the Draft Permit for Outfall 001
(e.g., flow rate, O&G, pH, benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, naphthalene, methyl tert-butyl ether) and the
additional parameters noted below:
• Total Flow;
• Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD);
• Dissolved Oxygen (DO);
• Total Surfactants;
• VOCs (Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Total Xylenes);

Page 35 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
•
•
•
•

PAHs (listed in Part I.A.1, Pollutant Scan, Effluent, benzo(a)anthracene through pyrene);
Total Recoverable Metals (chromium, iron, and as listed in Part I.A.1 of the Draft Permit for
Whole Effluent Toxicity, cadmium through zinc);
Ethanol, if tank or line being tested has been used to store and/or convey ethanol and/or
petroleum products containing ethanol within the previous year; and
Total Residual Chlorine, when potable water or a previously chlorinated source of water is
used for hydrostatic testing.

The Draft Permit requires the hydrostatic test waters released from the tank(s) and/or pipelines and
treated through the stormwater treatment system meet the effluent limitations and to satisfy all other
conditions of the Draft Permit. In addition, the Draft Permit requires the Permittee to routinely
observe the surface of the OWS during discharge of hydrostatic test waters, in order to detect any
increases in the separated oil layer and to prevent inadvertent release of hydrocarbons to the receiving
water. In the event that there is evidence of such a release (e.g., visible oil sheen and/or noticeable
increase in turbidity of discharge water), the Draft Permit requires the Permittee to immediately halt
the transfer of hydrostatic test water and take steps to correct the problem.
These requirements are intended to provide adequate characterization of the influent, in-process, and
effluent hydrostatic test water and are similar to requirements for similar facilities that discharge
hydrostatic test water to Massachusetts receiving waters under EPA’s RGP. Sampling of the above
parameters is necessary to identify whether there are any residual contaminants present in the
hydrostatic test water that might require the permit to be modified or reopened. Within 90 days of
completion of the hydrostatic test, the Permittee is required to submit a letter or report summarizing
the results of such test to EPA and MassDEP at the addresses provided in Part I. E.1.c. of the Draft
Permit. This report shall include the following information:
•
•
•
•

the date(s) during which the hydrostatic testing occurred;
the volume of hydrostatic test water discharged;
a copy of the laboratory data sheets for each analyses, providing the test method, the detection
limits for each analyte, and a brief discussion of whether all appropriate QA/QC procedures
were met and were within acceptable limits; and
a brief discussion of the overall test results and how they relate to the Effluent Limitations in
this permit.

All discharges of hydrostatic test water are subject to the numeric and non-numeric effluent
limitations in the Draft Permit.
7.7
Tank Bottom and Bilge Water
The bottom of many petroleum product storage tanks may contain a layer of water that has separated
from the stored petroleum product due to the density difference between the product and water. As
this water coalesces and then settles to the bottom of the tank, compounds including BTEX and PAHs
found in the product above it are able to partition and dissolve into the water. The partitioning and
dissolution allows the concentrations of some of the more soluble and denser petroleum components
to reach toxic levels. Facility operators drain this layer of water to prevent transfer with the finished
product as well as to free up valuable storage space.

Page 36 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
Whereas stormwater primarily contacts only those hydrocarbons present at the ground surface and
then generally only for short periods of time, tank bottom and bilge water remains in intimate
proximity with petroleum derivatives for prolonged periods, allowing toxic pollutants to dissolve into
the aqueous phase. EPA considers both tank-bottom and bilge water “process wastewater,” since
soluble toxic materials can partition from the petroleum product into the water over time. To protect
the Chelsea River from toxic pollutants dissolved in tank-bottom and bilge water, EPA is prohibiting
the Permittee from discharging any tank-bottom or bilge water alone or in combination with
stormwater or other wastewater unless specifically approved by EPA and MassDEP.
7.8
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan
On September 25, 1992, EPA promulgated through its General Permit for Stormwater Discharge
Associated with Industrial Activity, that the minimum BAT/BCT requirement for stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity is a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) [57
FR, 44438]. EPA has included SWPPP requirements in the Draft Permit because the majority of
wastewater discharged from the Terminal consists of stormwater. While the Terminal is ineligible for
the MSGP, the Terminal engages in activities that could result in the discharge of pollutants to waters
of the United States either directly or indirectly through stormwater runoff. These operations include
at least one of the following in an area potentially exposed to precipitation or stormwater: material
storage, in-facility transfer, material processing, material handling, or loading and unloading.
Specifically, at this Terminal, blending and distribution at the truck loading rack, infiltration of
groundwater into the stormwater collection system and routine maintenance and cleaning of the
stormwater treatment system components are examples of material storage, processing and handling
operations that must be included in the SWPPP.
To control activities/operations that could contribute pollutants to waters of the United States and
potentially violate Massachusetts WQSs, the Draft Permit requires the Terminal to continue to
implement, and maintain a SWPPP. This process involves the following four main steps:
•
•
•
•

Forming a team of qualified facility personnel who will be responsible for developing and
updating the SWPPP and assisting the Terminal manager in its implementation;
Assessing the potential stormwater pollution sources;
Selecting and implementing appropriate management practices and controls for these
potential pollution sources; and
Periodically re-evaluating the effectiveness of the SWPPP in preventing stormwater
contamination and overall compliance with the various terms and conditions of the Draft
Permit.

The goal of the SWPPP is to reduce, or prevent, the discharge of pollutants through the stormwater
system. The SWPPP serves to document the selection, design and installation of control measures,
including BMPs. Additionally, the SWPPP requirements in the Draft Permit are intended to facilitate
a systematic approach for the Permittee to properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of
treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or used to achieve compliance
with the conditions of this permit. The SWPPP shall be prepared in accordance with good
engineering practices and identify potential sources of pollutants, which may reasonably be expected

Page 37 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
to affect the quality of stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity from the Terminal.
The SWPPP documents measures implemented at the Terminal to satisfy the non-numeric
technology-based effluent limitations included in the Draft Permit. These non-numeric effluent
limitations support, and are equally enforceable as, the numeric effluent limitations included in the
Draft Permit.
Pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Act and 40 CFR §125.103(b), BMPs may be expressly incorporated
into a permit on a case-by-case basis where it is determined they are necessary to carry out the
provision of the CWA under Section 402(a)(1). These conditions apply to the Terminal because
Global stores and handles pollutants or products containing pollutants listed as toxic under Section
307(a)(1) of the CWA or pollutants listed as hazardous under Section 311 of the CWA and have
ancillary operations that could result in significant amounts of these pollutants reaching waters of the
United States. BMPs have been selected based on those appropriate for this specific facility (see
Sections 304(e) and 402(a)(1) of the CWA and 40 CFR §122.44(k)).
In essence, the SWPPP requirement directs the Permittee to review the physical equipment, the
operational procedures, and the operator training for the Terminal. The objective of this review is to
protect the local waterway by minimizing the pollutants discharged through inadequate facility
design, through human error, or through equipment malfunction. In concert with the EPA
requirements, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has also addressed BMPs in their regulations at
314 CMR 3.00.
EPA reviewed BMPs in the ELG Document, and BMPs selected for similar facilities that satisfy nonnumeric effluent limitations including minimizing exposure, implementing control measures,
preventative maintenance programs, and spill prevention and response procedures, and developing
management and handling protocols for sediment, runoff and run-on, hydrostatic testing, tank bottom
water, snow and ice control, nuisance vegetation control and ethanol storage. The Permittee may
select and implement BMPs as appropriate to meet the requirements in the Draft Permit. However,
the Draft Permit also includes the following site-specific BMPs:
•

•

The discharge practices BMP that requires, to the greatest extent practicable, the Permittee
describe the procedure for initiating discharge in order to minimize runoff, run-on and reentrainment of pollutants. This BMP also requires the Permittee avoid worst-case conditions,
generally identified as the period of time immediately before and after slack tide and periods
of lowest receiving water flow, when discharging. The BMP requires Global to identify other
site-specific factors that may contribute to worst-case conditions, determine if additional
controls are necessary that reduce the potential to contribute pollutants to stormwater, and
establish a minimum frequency for sweeping of paved surfaces. Discharge practices also
include those necessary to yield data representative of discharges from the Terminal and the
receiving water, where ambient sampling is required (e.g., operator protocols, sampling
location, sample collection, data quality assessment).
The spill control BMP requires the Permittee to document methods and measures intended to
reduce, minimize or eliminate the occurrence and impact of spills, document the procedure for
informing the appropriate entity of accidental releases at the Terminal, and maintain a record
of reportable releases at the Terminal. The Draft Permit does not authorize the discharge of

Page 38 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425

•

reportable quantities of petroleum products as a result of accidental release from the portions
of the Terminal covered by this permit through Outfall 001. Specific exceptions are described
in Part II to the Draft Permit, entitled “Standard Conditions”. MassDEP assumes
responsibility for reportable conditions required for certain spills under the MCP.
The stormwater system BMP requires the Permittee to evaluate the integrity of the stormwater
conveyance system, to determine the relative contribution of pollutants, if any, from contact
with potentially contaminated groundwater and soil. This BMP requires the Permittee to
document any stormwater system components that are potentially located below the high
groundwater table that are susceptible to groundwater infiltration. The Permittee must assess
through appropriate measures the level of infiltration that occurs (e.g., conduct a visual
inspection of the readily accessible portions of the stormwater conveyance system, and/or
measurement of groundwater and stormwater accumulation points as verification of
segregation). The Permittee is not required to evaluate components of the stormwater
conveyance system that are installed above grade for this BMP. Because this BMP is similar
to the triennial requirement described above, information collected in support of the triennial
requirement relevant to this BMP requirement may be used to satisfy this BMP.

The Draft Permit directs the Permittee to incorporate BMPs directly into the SWPPP. BMPs become
enforceable elements of the permit upon submittal of a SWPPP certification within 90 days of the
effective date of the permit. Therefore, BMPs are permit conditions comparable to the numerical
effluent limitations and are required to minimize the discharge of any pollutants through the proper
operation of the Terminal.
8. Essential Fish Habitat (EFH)
Under the 1996 Amendments (PL 104-267) to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
Management Act (16 U.S.C. §1801 et seq. (1998)), EPA is required to consult with the National
Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) if EPA’s actions or proposed actions that it funds, permits, or
undertakes, may adversely impact any essential fish habitat, such as waters and substrate necessary to
fish for spawning, breeding, feeding or growth to maturity (16 U.S.C. §1802(10)). “Adversely
impact” means any impact which reduces the quality and/or quantity of EFH (50 CFR §600.910(a)).
Adverse effects may include direct (e.g., contamination or physical disruption), indirect (e.g., loss of
prey, reduction in species’ fecundity), site-specific or habitat-wide impacts, including individual,
cumulative, or synergistic consequences of actions. Essential fish habitat is only designated for
species for which federal fisheries management plans exist (16 U.S.C. §1855(b)(1)(A)) EFH
designations for New England were approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce on
March 3, 1999.
EPA has determined that the Chelsea River is covered by the EFH designation for estuarine systems
at Latitude 42° 23’ 55” N Longitude 71° 00’ 40” W as determined by the NOAA EFH Mapper. 29 A
copy of the managed species within the EFH is included in Attachment 5. EPA also noted that the
documentation in support of the Boston Harbor Inner Harbor Maintenance Dredging Project
identified a “potential winter flounder spawning area” near the confluence of the Chelsea and Mystic
29

NOAA EFH Mapper available at http://www.nero.noaa.gov/hcd/index2a.htm

Page 39 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
rivers. 30 Winter flounder is covered under Essential Fish Habitat regulations. This species is a
commercially fished, federally managed, bottom dwelling fish. Winter flounder eggs and larvae are
typically found near the bottom in shallow areas. However, since winter flounder spawn on clean
sand, the deep navigation channel, with more silt by composition, in general, would not be expected
to be high quality spawning habitat for winter flounder.
EPA has concluded that the limits and conditions contained in this Draft Permit minimize adverse
effects to the EFH and managed species, if present, for the following reasons:
•
•
•

The frequency of discharge from the Terminal is limited (intermittent resulting almost entirely
from accumulation of stormwater);
The effluent limitations and other permit requirements identified in this Fact Sheet are
designed to be protective of all aquatic species, including those with EFH designations; and
The permit prohibits any violation of Massachusetts WQSs.

EPA believes that the conditions and limitations contained within the Draft Permit adequately protect
all aquatic life, including those species with EFH designation in Boston Harbor. Impacts associated
with issuance of this permit to the EFH species, their habitat and forage, have been minimized to the
extent that no significant adverse impacts are expected. Further mitigation is not warranted. If
adverse impacts to EFH are detected because of this permit action, or if new information is received
that changes the basis for EPA’s conclusion, NMFS will be notified and an EFH consultation will be
initiated.
9. Endangered Species Act (ESA)
Under Section 7(a) of the Endangered Species Act, every federal agency is required to ensure that
any action it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not likely to jeopardize federally listed endangered or
threatened species of fish, wildlife, or plants, or result in the adverse modification of critical habitat
of such species. EPA initiates consultation concerning listed species under their purviews with the
United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) for freshwater species, and the NMFS for marine
species and anadromous fish.
No federally listed threatened or endangered species have been identified for the City of Revere. 31 In
addition, EPA has reviewed the federal endangered or threatened species of fish, wildlife, and plants
in Suffolk County to determine if the re-issuance of this NPDES permit could potentially impact any
such listed species. No threatened species were identified for Suffolk County. 32
The known distribution of two endangered species of anadromous fish which occur in Massachusetts,
shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) and Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus), include

the Merrimack and Connecticut Rivers, and the Merrimack and Taunton Rivers, respectively. 33
However, adults may occur in estuarine and coastal habitats in Massachusetts. In addition, threatened
and endangered species of whale and sea turtle may be present in Boston Harbor.
The Terminal is located along a highly urbanized, tidally influenced river near the confluence with
the Mystic River. EPA received guidance from NMFS for the action area in this Draft Permit, which
stated that NMFS is “…not aware of any listed species that may be present within Chelsea Creek or
be affected by activities occurring in that area.” 34 Based on this assessment, EPA has determined that
no federally protected species are likely to be present in the action area. Therefore, consultation with
NMFS or the USF&WS under Section 7 of the ESA is not required.
10. Environmental Justice (EJ)
Executive Order 12898 entitled “Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-Income Populations” states in relevant part that “each Federal agency shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as
appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its
programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations...” The order
also provides that federal agencies are required to implement the order consistent with and to the
extent permitted by existing law. In addition, EPA adopted its “Proposed Regional Actions to
Promote Public Participation in the Permitting Process” in June 2012 (see 77 FR 3805). EPA
implemented a robust outreach and involvement process consistent with the Executive Order and
EPA policy that is described in detail in the Environmental Justice Analysis (EJA), which was
prepared in conjunction with the Draft Permit.
The Draft Permit implements existing water pollution prevention and control requirements, including
applicable technology-based and water quality-based limits, standards, and practices to ensure
compliance with applicable CWA requirements, and meet Massachusetts WQSs. As discussed in
detail in the EJA, EPA evaluated the potential for significant adverse effects within the Draft Permit’s
area of coverage and surrounding communities. The EJA describes the evaluation of the vulnerability
of these surrounding communities to the effects of the Terminal’s discharges. The EJA evaluates the
potential for disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects, which might
be unreasonable in relation to the benefits derived from the discharges.
In conjunction with EPA’s evaluation, several additional special conditions were included in the
Draft Permit to ensure adverse impacts do not occur because of discharges from the Terminal alone
or in combination with other discharges from similar facilities to Chelsea River. The Draft Permit
imposes a monitoring program to gather relevant information about potential effects of the discharges
to Chelsea River. Additionally, EPA has the authority to modify a permit if the threat of adverse
environmental impact from the discharges were to occur, that is, a discharge which violates WQSs or
causes or contributes to an excursion above WQC. The monitoring program is designed to obtain

additional information, which can be used in ongoing surveillance of permitted activities and in
future permit decisions.
EPA carefully considered the potential EJ impacts related to the Draft Permits’ authorized discharges,
especially the potential for disproportionate effects on communities and residents that reside in close
proximity to the Terminal or Chelsea River. EPA has determined that discharges authorized by the
Draft Permit will not violate WQSs. Where EPA determined that a pollutant has a reasonable
potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC, EPA has maintained or added numeric
WQBELs. EPA therefore determined that there will not be disproportionately high and adverse
human health or environmental effects with respect to these discharges on minority or low-income
populations residing in the Chelsea, Revere and East Boston areas of evaluation.
EPA’s evaluation and determinations are discussed in more detail in the EJA, which is included in the
administrative record associated with this permit (MA0003425).
11. Monitoring
The permit limitations and conditions have been established to yield data representative of the
discharges under the authority of Section 308(a) of the CWA, according to regulations set forth at 40
CFR §122.41(j), 122.44(i) and 122.48. The monitoring program in the permit specifies routine
sampling and analysis, which will provide continuous information on the reliability and effectiveness
of the installed pollution abatement equipment. The approved analytical procedures found in 40 CFR
Part 136 are required unless other procedures are explicitly required in the permit. The Permittee is
obligated to monitor and report sampling results to EPA and the MassDEP within the time specified
within the permit. Timely reporting is essential for the regulatory agencies to expeditiously assess
compliance with permit conditions.
NetDMR is a national web-based tool for regulated Clean Water Act permittees to submit discharge
monitoring reports (DMRs) electronically via a secure Internet application to EPA through the
Environmental Information Exchange Network. NetDMR allows participants to discontinue mailing
in hard copy forms under 40 CFR §122.41 and §403.12. NetDMR is accessed from the following url:
http://www.epa.gov/netdmr. Further information about NetDMR, including contacts for EPA Region
1, is provided on this website.
Global has been using NetDMR since 2010; therefore, the Draft Permit does not contain a
compliance schedule for NetDMR adoption. The Draft Permit requires the Permittee to report
monitoring results obtained during each calendar month using NetDMR, no later than the 15th day
of the month following the completed reporting period. All reports required under the permit shall
be submitted to EPA as an electronic attachment to the DMR, with the exception of the results of
hydrostatic testing, which are required in duplicate in hard copy form. When a permittee submits
reports using NetDMR, it is not required that hard copies of DMRs or other reports be submitted to
EPA (the results of hydrostatic testing) and hard copies of DMRs be submitted to MassDEP.
However, permittees must continue to send hard copies of reports other than DMRs to MassDEP
until further notice from MassDEP.

Page 42 of 42
NPDES Permit No. MA0003425
12. State Certification Requirements
EPA may not issue a permit unless the MassDEP certifies that the effluent limitations contained in
the permit are stringent enough to assure that the discharge will not cause the receiving water to
violate State Surface Water Quality Standards or unless state certification is waived. MassDEP staff
have reviewed the draft permit and advised EPA that the limitations are adequate to protect water
quality. EPA has requested permit certification by the State pursuant to 40 CFR §124.53 and expects
that the draft permit will be certified.
13. Comment Period, Hearing Requests, and Procedures for Final Decisions
All persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of the Draft Permit is inappropriate must

Response to Public Comments
In accordance with the provisions of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (“C.F.R.”) §124.17, this
document presents EPA’s responses to comments received on the following draft National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permits:
Chelsea Sandwich Terminal (#MA0003280)
Global REVCO Terminal (#MA0003298)
Global Petroleum Terminal (#MA0003425)
Global South Terminal (#MA0000825)
Gulf Oil Terminal (#MA0001091)
Irving Oil Terminal (#MA0001929)
Sunoco Logistics Terminal (#MA0004006)
The response to comments explains and supports the EPA determinations that form the basis of
the final permits. From March 14, 2014 to May 12, 2014, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
(“MassDEP”) (together, the “Agencies”) solicited public comments for the re-issuance of draft
NPDES permits for the seven terminals identified above. In addition, a joint public information
meeting and public hearing was held for interested members of the community in Chelsea,
Massachusetts on April 17, 2014.
The draft NPDES permits, developed pursuant to individual permit applications submitted by
each of the terminals identified above, authorize the discharge of treated stormwater and
hydrostatic test water. The Chelsea Sandwich Terminal, Global Petroleum Terminal, and Sunoco
Logistics Terminal also discharge treated groundwater. Further, the Chelsea Sandwich Terminal
discharges boiler blowdown. All of the terminals discharge to the Chelsea River. However, the
Global REVCO Terminal also discharges to Sales Creek, a tributary of Belle Isle Inlet.
After a review of the comments received, EPA and MassDEP have made a final decision to issue
these permits authorizing these discharges. The final permits are substantially similar to the draft
permits that were available for public comment.
Although EPA’s decision-making process has benefitted from the comments and additional
information submitted, the information and arguments presented did not raise any substantial
new questions concerning the permits. EPA did, however, make minor changes in response to
comments which are summarized in Attachment 1. The analyses underlying these changes are
explained in the responses to individual comments that follow and are reflected in the final
permits. Comments, received in writing and/or submitted during the public hearing, are
organized into three sections: Part I addresses comments submitted which pertain to all seven
draft NPDES permits; Part II addresses comments submitted which pertain to a specific
individual draft permit; and Part III addresses comments received on the Environmental Justice
Analysis (“EJA”) issued concurrently with the draft permits. Comments may be paraphrased.
Copies of the final permits may be obtained by writing or calling EPA’s NPDES Industrial

Public Comments
Part I. Comments submitted on all seven draft permits identified above:
Comment submitted by Jack P. Schwartz, PhD, Annisquam River Marine Fisheries
Station, Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries:
Comment A1:
Among the seven draft NPDES permits, the concentration units required for metals such as
chromium and iron are micrograms per liter while others such as copper, lead, nickel and zinc
are milligrams per liter. Please advise if this is in error and if so, which concentration units are
correct.
Response to Comment A1:
The draft permits required reporting concentrations of multiple metals. Metals required for the
chemical analysis portion of the whole effluent toxicity (“WET”) test (Section IV. of Attachment
A, Marine Acute Toxicity Test Procedure and Protocol) are most commonly listed in milligrams
per liter (“mg/L”). A number of additional metals typical in EPA Region 1’s Remediation
General Permit (“RGP”) are most commonly listed in micrograms per liter (“µg/L”) as is the
minimum level (“ML”) for analysis for each metal, where specified in footnotes for Part I.A.
While neither case is a typographical error, EPA has changed all metals concentration units in
the final permits to µg/L, to be consistent. These units align with the concentration units typical
of EPA’s National Recommended Water Quality Criteria and the levels at which these metals
would be expected in effluent at the facilities. The change is reflected in Part I.A. of each of the
permits, including footnotes, if applicable.
Comments submitted by Ek OngKar Singh Khalsa, Executive Director, Mystic River
Watershed Association:
Comment B1:
MyRWA considers these permits particularly important due to the impaired state of Chelsea
River due to petroleum hydrocarbons. MyRWA would first like to register its support for the
general improvements made to the discharge permits with respect to the addition of analytes,
increased sampling requirements and the use of human health WQCs as discharge limitation
concentrations for key pollutants.
Response to Comment B1:
EPA notes the comment.
Comment B2:

1. Improved specificity regarding timing of sampling of receiving environment and toxicity
testing. The draft permits require that the samples of the receiving water bodies be collected in
May and September respectively (the September sampling is required as part of the WET
testing), but the language does not specify when in May and September or under what kinds of
conditions sampling should occur. The permittees should be required to ensure that the sampling
reflects conditions under which discharges would commonly occur. For example, “after the first
period of wet weather in May” may be more appropriate. The permit should require that samples
be collected on the out-going tide or at low tide in order to characterize as much as possible
Chelsea River water quality rather than inputs from Boston Harbor. Furthermore, if all seven
facilities were required to sample the river on the same day this would likely provide a more
useful data set for EPA and MassDEP to evaluate potential impacts of stormwater discharge on
the waterbody.
Response to Comment B2:
Part I.A. of the permits requires sampling of discharges from the facilities to yield data
representative of the discharge under authority of Section 308(a) in accordance with 40 C.F.R.
§122.41(j), §122.44(i), and §122.48. In addition, the BMP requirement under Part C. Stormwater
Pollution Prevention Plan (adjusted to Part C. Non-Numeric Technology-Based Effluent
Limitations (“TBELs”) in the final permits as defined below) requires the Permittees to
document discharge practices that minimize the extent to which discharges from the facilities
occur under worst-case conditions in the receiving water, and limits the runoff, run-on and reentrainment of pollutants. Several requirements are specified, including discharging, and
therefore sampling, during an outgoing tide, but not during periods of critical low flow or the
stagnation point at low tide or high tide.
Based on the sampling requirements included in the draft permits, receiving water sampling at
each facility will allow comparability with each facility’s effluent data. However, EPA agrees
that more specific requirements for receiving water samples will yield a more representative data
set for the conditions of the receiving water and any whole effluent effect. By defining more
precise spatial and temporal requirements, the receiving water data will have more comparability
for the watershed.
In increasing the specificity of receiving water sample requirements, EPA acknowledges that
discharges from the facilities are intermittent. Because discharges consist almost entirely of
stormwater, by volume, a prescribed day and time (i.e., point in the tidal stage) for sampling may
not always be feasible, since receiving water samples must be collected concurrently with
effluent samples. To provide more specificity, EPA has added a definition of a qualifying
discharge event. The permits have adjusted receiving water sampling requirements for the
pollutant scan and wet test to require sampling the first qualifying event that occurs in each
required month. To identify a qualifying event, the permittee may use tide charts to predict when
sampling can be conducted. 1 A qualifying event is defined as an outgoing tide at least one hour
from both the low and high slack tide. If a measurable discharge does not occur such that
concurrent effluent sampling cannot be completed during the first qualifying event of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide prediction chart for Chelsea, Massachusetts: Station ID:
8443725.

required month, the permittee is to sample the next qualifying event. For example, in October
2014, the first qualifying event, assuming a facility discharges, occurs on October 1 between
5:49 and 10:01 am. Because the definition of a qualifying event also applies to discharges, EPA
has also revised the discharge practices BMP to specify the tide-related restrictions.
Further, EPA has adjusted the required sampling month for the required pollutant scan from May
to April, to better characterize the effect of spring wet weather when pollutant concentrations
would be expected to be greater (i.e., early spring following snow and ice melt). EPA has also
included coordination of sample timing with the six other bulk terminals, to the extent possible,
in the discharge practices BMP. EPA regards this voluntary coordination as an incentive factor to
consider on a case-by-case basis under Interim Guidance for Performance-Based Reduction of
NPDES Permit Monitoring Frequencies in the event monitoring frequency reductions are
requested.2
Comment B3:
2. Increased frequency of sampling of the receiving waterbody. As discussed above the draft
permits require sampling of the receiving waterbodies twice annually. It is recommended that
sampling of the receiving water bodies for all analytes included in the permits and the pollutant
scan be increased to quarterly. Data regarding pollutant concentration and variability in the
receiving water are used by the EPA and MassDEP to develop these and future NPDES permits.
The data used by the EPA and MassDEP is determined from the permits’ re-issuance
applications, monthly discharge monitoring reports (DMRs) and State and Federal Quality
Reports.3 While many of these data are not immediately available for public review, given the
2005 and 2006 permit requirements with respect to frequency of sampling and the parameters
included in the past permits, it is reasonable to suspect that the existing data set is very limited
and decision-making would be improved by an increase in water chemistry data.
Response to Comment B3:
The receiving water sampling included in the draft permits is included under two different
requirements with differing rationale. The receiving water sampling required under the Whole
Effluent Toxicity Testing Chemical Analysis is part of the Marine Acute Toxicity Protocol. EPA
included the parameters in the permit table so that they would be reported through NetDMR,
eliminating duplicative data tabulation efforts. The pollutant scan of the receiving water is
explicitly required in accordance with 40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C) where indicator
parameters have been used to limit a class of pollutants (i.e., benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene for
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene for volatile organic compounds). Effluent
monitoring requirements in NPDES permits are established on a case-by-case basis at a
frequency necessary to determine compliance with permit limitations and conditions, and to
evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and control measures, and permit limitations. Regulations
at 40 C.F.R. 122.44(i)(2) establish a floor, or minimum frequency for monitoring results of no
See EPA 833-B-96-001, April 1996.

(NPDES) Permit to Discharge to Waters of the United States pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA), NPDES

less than once per year. Annual frequency is generally for monitoring only, that is, where a
pollutant or parameter does not require a water quality-based effluent limitation (“WQBEL”). A
number of factors are considered in establishing a case-by-case monitoring frequency, including
effluent variability, the type of treatment provided to the effluent, the type, significance and
persistence of the pollutants, the cost of such a monitoring schedule relative to the benefit, and
the compliance history of the facility.
In response to this and several comments received, EPA has reconsidered the number of samples
for both the effluent and the receiving water necessary to increase the data quality, reduce the
standard deviation (i.e., variability), and increase the confidence level of the data set. Over a
five-year permit term, annual sampling will yield 5 data points per facility, and 35 data points
overall. Over the same term, quarterly sampling will yield 20 data points per facility, and 140
data points overall, while monthly sampling will yield 60 data points per facility, and 420 data
points overall, assuming no frequency reductions are allowed.
An expected benefit of an increased monitoring frequency is to better characterize the quality
and variability of the effluent and receiving water, which in turn ensures permit compliance.
Compliance with new WQBELs derived from human health criteria for pollutants for which the
receiving water is impaired and facilities are identified as a source is of significant concern.
Additional benefits include an increase in the data quality by increasing the size of the data set
for facilities and the receiving water, and increasing sampling for pollutants of identified
environmental and human health significance in the watershed. In general, a larger sample size
results in a greater confidence level that the sample collected is representative of the actual
concentration of a parameter in the effluent at any given time.
Therefore, EPA believes that for the pollutants with WQBELs or requirements, or limits based
on human health criteria, initial monitoring frequencies should be increased, as suggested, in the
short term. First, the ambient monitoring requirements under Part I.A. Pollutant Scan, Receiving
Water are inextricably linked to effluent limitations based on human health criteria, pursuant to
40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C) as ambient monitoring is necessary for EPA to monitor
compliance with WQSs. As a result, the receiving water sample for this requirement has been
increased to quarterly in the final permits. Second, the ambient monitoring requirements under
Part I.A. Whole Effluent Toxicity Testing Chemical Analysis is inextricably linked to Whole
Effluent Toxicity testing of the effluent, based on the need to assess acute toxicity in the effluent.
As a result, the receiving water sample for this requirement has been increased to quarterly in the
final permits. However, given that the characteristics of the effluent in the short term are
expected to remain consistent and the cost burden of increased sampling and analysis is high for
organic pollutants and whole effluent toxicity, the increased monitoring frequencies are effective
for the first three years of the permit term. Three years represents the period of time required for
a quarterly sampling frequency to generate the number of samples recommended in EPA’s
Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control for evaluation and
analysis. Three years is also an appropriate period for calculating a long term average under
EPA’s Interim Guidance for Performance Based Reductions of NPDES Permit Monitoring
Frequencies. After three years, the monitoring frequencies will automatically reduce to once per
year. Over a five-year permit term, quarterly sampling for the first three years and annual
sampling for an additional two years will yield 14 data points per facility, and 98 data points
7

overall. The final permits provide permittees the ability to request further reductions in writing, if
warranted, which must be granted in writing by EPA and MassDEP.
The list of parameters required for ambient sampling remain those under the pollutant scan,
receiving water, and WET testing chemical analysis. These analytes include all parameters
limited in all permits, and all parameters with required monitoring, with the exception of select
parent oxygenates that are either no longer in use or have a residence time in surface water
shorter than is likely to be detected in the receiving water (i.e., EPA requires monitoring for tertbutyl alcohol, a breakdown compound, rather than methyl-tert-butyl-ether (“MtBE”), the parent
compound).
Comment B4:
3. Field screening of basic water chemistry parameters prior to discharge. In reviewing the
sampling results from the past five years as provided in the Fact Sheets, in some cases discharges
were released to Chelsea River with pH values as low as 2.96.4 It is recommended that field
measurements of pH be required prior to discharge to prevent such discharges and prohibit
discharges except if the pH value is between 6.5 and 8.5 SU.
Response to Comment B4:
The low pH value referenced above was reported by Gulf Oil Terminal in error. The Permittee
utilizes a number of sampling containers, some of which contain preservative chemicals
consistent with analytical methods in 40 C.F.R. Part 136. On the January 31, 2012 occasion, pH
was not collected in the appropriate sample container and preservative impacted the reported
value. EPA advised the Permittee during permit development that in the event of a sampling
error, the Permittee should collect additional samples for the purposes of reporting and explain
the error.
Rainwater in the New England region as reported by the National Atmospheric Deposition
Program is frequently outside the allowable permitted range. However, the surface materials at
the terminals which contact rainwater appear to provide a buffering effect prior to the discharge
of stormwater, such that pH across the seven facilities only exceeded pH limits 12 times across
all samples over the previous five years (approximately 420 samples. Four of seven facilities
reported no exceedances, one facility reported one exceedance, one facility reported four
exceedances and one facility reported seven exceedances. The final permits, upon request of
several permittees, include the allowance for collecting and submitting on-site rainwater samples
to determine pH impacts to stormwater prior to accumulation and discharge. This additional
provision was added because Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality Standards at 314 Code of
Massachusetts Regulations (“C.M.R.”) 4.05(4)(b)3, which, in addition to requiring pH to be
within the range of 6.5 to 8.5 SU, also prohibits discharges that cause the in-stream pH to change
more than 0.2 SU outside of the background range. Acidic rainwater has the potential to impact

the pH range of surface runoff independent of effluent generated at the facilities. These data
allow the facilities to identify such an issue and report it to EPA and MassDEP.
Further, since the pH standard applies instream, EPA does not believe collecting additional predischarge measurements of pH will inform compliance. The effluent limitations remain
unchanged and any value reported outside of this range is considered a permit limit exceedance.
In addition, EPA notes that in the event of a violation of any permit condition, including an
exceedance of the numeric limits for pH, the permittees are required to review and potentially
revise control measures through corrective action to eliminate such an occurrence. The corrective
action requirements were included in the draft permits in Part I.C.1 h-j and by reference in Part
I.C.1.a. To provide greater specificity for a portion of the referenced requirements, the final
permits include a stand-alone corrective action requirement. The final permits contain these
provisions largely verbatim from Part 3. of EPA’s current Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP)
(effective May 27, 2009). However, where a provision included in the MSGP is phrased
inappropriately for an individual permit or is otherwise unclear, the provision wording has been
adjusted. However, provisions remain substantially identical to those abbreviated or included by
reference in the draft permits. Provisions included in the MSGP that do not apply to the facilities
have been omitted. As the corrective action requirements in EPA’s MSGP are more complete
than the portion added to the final permits, the references to EPA’s MSGP, remain. The final
permits also include the allowance for collection of pH measurements of rainwater if the
permittee anticipates or measures effluent outside of the permitted range that the permittee
believes is due to rainwater conditions, as allowed under Massachusetts’ WQSs.
EPA expects that once the discharges contact ambient water, the effluent will be sufficiently
“buffered” such that no change in ambient pH levels will occur due to any of the facilities
discharges.
Comment B5:
4. Increased frequency of sampling in the event of a reported exceedance. It is recommended that
in the event that a parameter is above or outside of the discharge limitation the facilities be
required to sample and analyze all discharges until the parameter once again meets the permit
requirements. This data will help characterize the extent of potential impacts of an exceedance as
well as identify any systemic failures in the SWPP that need to be addressed.
Response to Comment B5:
Requirements included in the permits address corrective actions as they are required for
documentation in the facility’s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). Specifically,
Part I.C. of the draft permits (adjusted to Part D. Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan in the
final permits as defined below) includes the requirement that the facilities SWPPPs are
consistent with the general provisions for SWPPPs included in EPA’s Multi-Sector General
Permit for discharges of stormwater associated with industrial activity (effective May 27, 2009)
included in Part 5 and Part 8.AD., including documentation for corrective actions taken. The
corrective action requirements have been moved to Part C. Non-numeric Technology-Based
Effluent Limitations and Additional Requirements in the final permits to better distinguish
9

between limitations and requirements (i.e., non-numeric TBELs, control measures, inspections,
and corrective actions) and documentation and certification requirements (i.e., SWPPP).
Further, since the provisions pertaining to control measures, inspections and corrective actions
included by reference to EPA’s Multi-Sector General Permit in the draft permits are potentially
related to an exceedance of a permit effluent limitation, characterization of potential impacts of
an exceedance, and/or identification of inadequacies in a facility’s SWPPP, EPA has clarified
several requirements for control measures, inspections, and corrective actions. Specifically, the
control measures included by reference under SWPPP requirements in Part C.1.b-f. in the draft
permits and by reference to EPA’s MSGP now include the design considerations applicable to
Part 8.AD. and, in limited instances, 8.P. of EPA’s MSGP in Part C.2. of the final permits. The
inspection requirements included under SWPPP requirements in Part C.1.g. of the draft permits
have been moved to Part C.5. in the final permits. The control measure requirements abbreviated
under SWPPP requirements in Part C.1.h-j. of the draft permits and included by reference to
EPA’s MSGP, have been moved to Part I.C.7. of the final permits and expanded to include a
portion of the referenced provisions. The minimum documentation requirements included by
reference to EPA’s MSGP for control measures (including Best Management Practices (BMPs)),
inspections, and corrective action have been added to Part D.1.d. of the final permits for greater
specificity. Since the requirements in EPA’s MSGP are more complete than the portions added
to the final permits, the references to EPA’s MSGP requirements for sector AD, and P, if
applicable, as well as the general SWPPP requirements included in Part 5, remain.
EPA believes the monitoring requirements in the permit are sufficient to yield data representative
of the variability expected in the effluent. However, based on the commenter’s suggestions, EPA
is including more specific language from the provisions in the MSGP SWPPP Corrective
Actions section to ensure that corrective actions are implemented and documented properly in
the facilities’ SWPPPs and the non-numeric TBELs in the permits are met. For additional
clarification, the non-numeric TBELs have been separated from the SWPPP as described in
Response to Comment B6, below.
The EPA NPDES permitting program does not typically include automatic, additional
monitoring in NPDES permits once a limit is exceeded. However, it is possible that EPA’s
compliance program could require additional or ongoing monitoring if permit limit exceedances
occur.
Comment B6:
5. Improved public access to the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans (SWPPPs) and
Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs). MyRWA requests that the SWPPPs be submitted to
EPA for approval, made available electronically upon request, and that the DMRs also be made
available electronically upon request one year after the effective date of the permit.
Response to Comment B6:
The SWPPP itself does not contain numeric effluent limitations. The SWPPP is intended to
document the selection, design, and installation of control measures. These measures are selected
10

by permittees from a large variety of widely used and effective engineering practices. As distinct
from the limitations, the documentation requirements are intended to document the
implementation (including inspections, control measures, monitoring, and corrective actions) of
the permit requirements. To clarify the distinction between the permit conditions and the
documentation through a SWPPP, EPA has divided the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan
part (Part C.) into two parts. Part C. Non-numeric Technology-Based Effluent Limitations and
Additional Requirements, includes the non-numeric TBELs, control measures, inspections and
corrective action requirements, and Part D. Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan includes the
documentation and certification requirements for the SWPPP.
Given the distinction between the limitations and the documentation requirements, EPA required
in the draft permits that SWPPPs be developed, but not submitted to EPA unless requested. EPA
continues to believe approval of a facility’s SWPPP is not necessary to ensure the facilities are
meeting their non-numeric TBELs as the SWPPP serves as the record of the activities completed
to meet the effluent limitations and requirements in the permits. The elements of the SWPPPs
required in the permit are significantly identical to those required of facilities discharging
stormwater associated with industrial activity, covered under EPA’s MSGP. Similarly, SWPPPs
prepared under the MSGP are not submitted to EPA for approval. EPA does not believe the
stormwater discharges from these facilities differs from the much larger body of permitted
facilities under EPA’s MSGP, such that EPA should approve a SWPPP in the instance of these
facilities.
Nevertheless, EPA is committed to transparency and public accountability regarding compliance
and enforcement performance for these facilities. The draft permits included the requirement that
the permittees submit copies of their SWPPPs to the municipality in which they are located and
to submit Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs) to EPA and MassDEP to allow members of the
public to access these documents. The final permits further require that the permittees post a
copy of the facility’s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (including its annual certifications,
updates and BMP implementation documentation) and discharge monitoring data (including any
reports) to their respective company’s publicly-accessible internet webpage if practicable. If a
permittee determines this requirement is impracticable, EPA anticipates requesting copies of
SWPPPs be submitted to EPA for posting via its website. DMR data will remain accessible
through EPA’s Enforcement and Compliance History Online (“ECHO”) website.5 Since the
SWPPP and DMR data become public record when submitted to the municipalities and/or
Agencies, this requirement serves only to allow ease of access for interested persons. This
requirement is within the Agency’s discretion under Clean Water Act Sections 402(a) and
308(a). Sections 402(a) provides that: “The Administrator shall prescribe conditions for permits
to assure compliance…including conditions on data and information collection, reporting, and
such other requirements as he deems appropriate.” Section 308(a) authorizes the Agency to
require owners/operators to “make such reports” and “provide such other information as [the
Administrator] may reasonably require.” This requirement advances Clean Water Act goals by
increasing public awareness through public web reporting and thereby improving compliance by
providing companies with greater incentive to comply with their permits. If the permittee deems
this requirement impracticable, alternatively, the information will be requested by EPA and
becomes available at the Region 1 EPA office.

Comment B7:
6. Clarification regarding sampling timing during discharge event. The Draft Permits stipulate
that “all [effluent] samples shall be grab samples taken within 15 minutes of the initiation of
discharge from the outfall where practicable, but in no case later than within the first hour of
discharge from the outfall”. Can the EPA confirm that such a sampling routine will provide the
highest concentrations of pollutants given the configuration of all of the stormwater management
facilities and the characteristics of the water quality parameters? For example, are there facilities
that discharge from the bottom of a tank/reservoir that would yield the highest concentrations of
lightweight pollutants such as VOCs near the end of the discharge event?
Response to Comment B7:
EPA believes sample collection within the first 15 minutes of the initiation of discharge will
yield data representative of the effluent after treatment for comparison to the effluent limitations.
EPA required sampling within the first fifteen minutes of the initiation of discharge to capture a
representation of effluent quality, but is likely to capture higher than average concentrations.
Where a daily maximum limit applies, this does not necessarily equate to a maximum
instantaneous limit (i.e., the highest possible concentration). When a daily maximum limit is an
acute criteria, it is based on an averaging period, typically of four hours. The limits for many of
the organic compounds in the permits are monthly average, for which an instantaneous
maximum has even less comparability, as the averaging period is longer still.
The facilities also typically do not retain stormwater in enclosed vessels, where phase separation
is more likely. The transfer of effluent is such that pollutants which may undergo phase
separation while in storage, remix upon transfer through the facilities’ stormwater conveyance
and treatment systems prior to discharge. Lightweight pollutants such as volatile organic
compounds are of greater concern in tank bottom/bilge water and hydrostatic test water effluent.
To ensure lighter phase pollutants are not discharged at concentrations that would exceed permit
effluent limitations, EPA specifically prohibited discharges of tank bottom/bilge water and
included expanded sampling requirements specific to hydrostatic test water discharges, including
sampling near the end of a tank discharge, where lightweight pollutants are more likely present.
For facilities that discharge groundwater remediation effluent, the groundwater treatment
systems extract groundwater, treat groundwater and discharge treated groundwater in series. This
batch process method of treatment is not likely to promote phase separation (e.g., individual
lighter pollutants separate from the blended liquid and migrate to the top of the batch water
column) as groundwater is treated upon extraction from groundwater extraction wells. Finally,
for the facility that discharges boiler blowdown, lightweight pollutants are not expected to be
present.
Given the concern for phase separation and in consideration of additional comments (see
Comments L6, M8, N6, O6, and R2 in Part II, below) received regarding the necessity of certain
samples in the hydrostatic test process, EPA has modified the requirements for hydrostatic test
12

water discharges such that sampling must occur during the first 10%, mid-point and last 10% of
the discharge after treatment, rather than in-process prior to treatment (also see Response to
Comment R2). EPA believes this sampling adjustment will yield data which are better
representative of any potential phase separation and will better quantify any variability in
hydrostatic test water discharges. In revising the requirements for hydrostatic test water
sampling, EPA noted that monitoring for total recoverable chromium was inadvertently omitted
from the list of parameters for three of seven permits: Irving Oil Terminal, Global Petroleum
Terminal and Sunoco Logistics Terminal. Total recoverable chromium is described in each
permits’ fact sheet Part 7.6, Hydrostatic Testing. This parameter has been added to the
hydrostatic test water sampling requirements in the final permits.
Comment B8:
7. Increased frequency of EPA and DEP unannounced inspections. At least one annual
inspection of each petroleum terminal is necessary to review the facility compliance status.
Response to Comment B8:
EPA understands that a comprehensive and robust compliance and enforcement program is a
critical component of an effective NPDES program. EPA uses a number of mechanisms,
including inspections, to ensure compliance with the permits. Inspections of facilities with
NPDES permits are performed by EPA Region 1’s Office of Environmental Stewardship. EPA’s
Office of Site Remediation and Restoration also regularly inspects the bulk fuel storage facilities
for their compliance with the Oil Pollution Act. Additionally, these facilities are inspected by
MassDEP. EPA’s inspection frequency depends on such factors as the regulatory requirements
of the program, the compliance history of the facility, the EPA resources available to perform
inspections and the extent of competing environmental priorities. Monitoring results are
reviewed with the goal of prioritizing inspections as well as for resolving any violations
identified in a timely manner. EPA attempts to take all of the above factors into account when
developing an appropriate inspection frequency. The inspections conducted by EPA include both
announced and unannounced inspections. Depending upon the specific circumstances of an
inspection, the permittee may or may not be notified prior to the inspection. Each agency and
program uses different criteria to determine the most appropriate type of inspection.
In addition, the draft permits required qualified personnel to conduct quarterly facility
inspections and maintain documentation regarding inspection activities as part of the facility’s
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan. The draft permits also included by reference, the control
measures and corrective actions required for the applicable sectors in EPA’s MSGP. Certain
corrective actions are required of the facility as a result of routine inspection, including when
control measures are identified as inadequate to meet the non-numeric TBELs and additional
requirements (i.e., control measures, facility inspections and corrective actions). As explained in
Response to Comment B6, to provide greater specificity with regard to quarterly inspections,
control measures and corrective actions, EPA has separated these requirements from the SWPPP,
instead including them in Part C. Non-numeric Technology-based Effluent Limitations and
Additional Requirements. In addition, as explained in Response to Comment B5, several
provisions pertaining to control measures, inspections, and corrective actions included in the
13

draft permits largely by reference to EPA’s MSGP have been specifically incorporated into the
final permits to provide greater clarity.
Comments submitted by Staci Rubin, Senior Attorney, Environmental Justice Legal
Services Director, Alternatives for Community & Environment, Inc., on behalf of residents
of Chelsea and East Boston6
Comment C1:
This comment letter is filed on behalf of residents of Chelsea and East Boston whom
Alternatives for Community & Environment (“ACE”) is assisting in the matter of draft permits
for the seven bulk petroleum storage facilities along the Chelsea River.
As explained in detail in these comments, the EPA should deny all seven bulk petroleum
terminals National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permits because: (1) the
draft permits were issued prior to establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads for the Chelsea
River and Sales Creek; (2) the draft permits do not consider climate change/disruption/warming
conditions; and (3) the cumulative impacts of releases from all seven petroleum terminals were
not adequately analyzed as required by the Executive Order on Environmental Justice. If the
agencies disagree with these comments and decide to issue final permits, the residents request
several conditions be added to the final permits for all seven facilities as discussed below.
Response to Comment C1:
The prohibitions applicable to the issuance of NPDES permits by EPA are contained in 40
C.F.R. §122.4. Neither a lack of a Total Maximum Daily Load nor failure to consider climate
change/disruption/warming conditions are cited as reasons for prohibiting the issuance of
NPDES permits. Additionally, 40 C.F.R. §122.64 outlines causes for NPDES permit termination
or denial of a permit renewal application. EPA notes that: 1) the lack of a total maximum daily
load (“TMDL”); 2) failure to consider climate change; and 3) failure to adequately consider
cumulative impacts under the Executive Order on Environmental Justice do not explicitly appear
among the list of causes for permit termination or re-application denial under these regulations.
Moreover, based on the numeric and non-numeric effluent limitations and requirements included
in the permits, EPA believes that the permits provide for compliance with applicable
requirements of the Clean Water Act and ensure compliance with Massachusetts Surface Water
Quality Standards (Massachusetts’ “WQSs”). Furthermore, EPA expects that the State will
certify the permits under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. Therefore, no prohibition noted in
these implementing regulations warrants denial of the NPDES permit reissuance.
Further explanation regarding the TMDL for Chelsea River and consideration of climate change
are provided in response to Comment C2 and Response to Comment C3, respectively.

With regard to the permit reissuances to these facilities and Executive Order 12898 (59 Fed. Reg.
7629, February 11, 1994), entitled “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in
Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations”, each federal agency is required to “make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate,
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs,
policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States.
. . .” Executive Order 12898, § 1-101. As noted in the permits’ fact sheets, EPA thoroughly
considered environmental justice issues in the development of the draft permits, including review
of data evaluated for an EJA. Whether addressing adverse impacts is appropriate or actionable by
EPA is dependent upon the existing environmental laws and their implementing regulations
governing EPA’s authorities. EPA believes it has used its authority under the Clean Water Act
section 402(a) to incorporate limitations connected to water quality impacts or technology-based
limitations that address environmental justice concerns documented in the EJA.
Executive Order 12898 itself is not a source of authority. As noted by the Environmental
Appeals Board, the Executive Order does not “amend EPA’s statutory or regulatory
requirements and obligations. The Executive Order emphasizes that all of its directives to
agencies are to be implemented ‘[t]o the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law.’
Further, the Order concludes by stating that ‘[t]his order is intended only to improve the internal
management of the executive branch and is not intended to, nor does it create, any right, benefit,
or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against
the United States, it agencies, its officers, or any persons’”.7 As the EPA has recently explained,
“the only legal requirements applicable to EPA regional offices and permit applicants throughout
the permitting process are those contained in the EPA’s environmental statutes, implementing
regulations, the Administrative Procedure Act, applicable anti-discrimination laws and other
applicable statutes and regulations.”8 In short, the Executive Order grants no additional authority
to EPA; any denial of a permit application (or renewal) must be in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations, including the Clean Water Act. Moreover, in this instance, the Clean Water
Act does not appear to provide any general authority to deny permits based on environmental
justice considerations that are unconnected to water quality impacts or technology-based
limitations.9
With regard to cumulative impacts, Section 3-3 of the Executive Order, titled “Research, Data
Collection, and Analysis”, sub-section 3-301, titled “Human Health and Environmental Research
and Analysis” states, “[e]nvironmental human health analyses, whenever practicable and
appropriate, shall identify multiple and cumulative exposures.” The National Recommended
Water Quality Criteria used to calculate numeric effluent limitations in the permits are derived in
consideration of acceptable levels of risk for a receptor through water-related exposure routes.
These criteria have been promulgated by both EPA and MassDEP. For certain petroleum
hydrocarbon indicator parameters (e.g., benzene, and benzo(a)pyrene) EPA selected the human

health criteria based on exposure through fish consumption. Any human health criterion for a
toxicant is based on at least three interrelated considerations: 1) cancer potency or systemic
toxicity; 2) exposure; and 3) risk characterization.10
EPA considered cumulative impacts, addressed interchangeably as cumulative effects, as EPA
policy and guidance prescribes in the context of NPDES permits. Cumulative impacts in this
context are considered the combined impacts to water quality of a receiving water from
aggregate contributions of one or more pollutants, including any impacts in combination. A
cumulative impact analysis, in the same context, is an analysis, characterization, and possible
quantification of the combined impacts to human health or the environment from aggregate
contributions of one or more pollutants, including any impacts in combination. One key aspect of
this definition is that a cumulative impact analysis need not necessarily be quantitative.
Therefore, under the scope of the Clean Water Act, EPA’s approach considered the data
available, the nature of the water quality concerns, the sources of pollutants and their
characteristics, and the relationships among those sources following EPA guidance. As explained
more thoroughly in the permits’ fact sheets, EPA, in developing the effluent limitations and
monitoring requirements for the reissuance of the seven permits, considered cumulative effects
of the loading of pollutants to the receiving water, including additive and/or synergistic effects.
EPA considered each facility as a point source in the context of other point sources, including the
six other facilities, and non-point sources as they can be discerned using available receiving
water data, and the physical and chemical conditions of the receiving water.
In setting effluent limitations, EPA typically adheres to the guidance in EPA’s Technical Support
Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control,11 and EPA’s NPDES Permit Writers'
Manual.12 EPA has addressed relevant aspects of cumulative exposure and potential impacts in
the context of this permitting action consistent with the Technical Support Document for Water
Quality-based Toxics Control as described below.
EPA follows the guidance in Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics
Control to determine if any pollutant or pollutant parameter (conventional, non-conventional,
and toxic) that is or may be discharged causes or has the “reasonable potential” to cause or
contribute to an excursion above any water quality standard (40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)). An
excursion occurs if the projected or actual in-stream concentration exceeds an applicable water
quality criterion. In determining “reasonable potential,” EPA considers:
1. Existing controls on point and non-point sources of pollution;
2. Pollutant concentration and variability in the effluent and receiving water as determined
from the best available information
3. The sensitivity of the indicator species used in toxicity testing, where required;
4. Known water quality impacts of processes on waste waters; and
5. Dilution of the effluent in the receiving water.

131.11).

In a strictly quantitative approach, EPA tabulates available data, determines the applicable water
quality criteria and statistically projects concentrations based on available effluent data using a
steady state mixing that accounts for the contribution of the discharge, by volume as compared to
the receiving water under worst case conditions, and the concentration already present in the
receiving water. EPA completed this analysis when available data were sufficient, as was the
case for several permits for the oxygenate MtBE. However, significant data gaps were noted
which prevented EPA from utilizing specific values for many of the remaining pollutants of
concern. EPA’s alternative approach to determine reasonable potential given the insufficiency of
specific data is given below.
EPA followed the Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control in a
combined qualitative approach in the absence of effluent data to determine whether there is
reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above any water quality criteria.
Given the impairments to the receiving water and the level of concern associated with the
pollutants present in the discharges, EPA properly applied a margin of error through application
of several assumptions. For example, in addition to pollutants previously monitored by the
permittees, EPA identified multiple additional parameters potentially present in the discharges or
that could come into contact with discharges at the facilities based on guidance documents and
supplemental information detailed in the permits’ fact sheets. As explained in the permits’ fact
sheets, EPA also did not allow a mixing zone in the receiving water. EPA further assumed each
chemical-specific parameter already exceeded applicable criteria in the receiving water, in light
of the impairments related to petroleum and petroleum hydrocarbons and insufficient data to
determine otherwise. In determining whether the discharge would meet water quality standards,
EPA assumed each chemical-specific parameter would be discharged by the facilities up to the
maximum permitted quantity, and that effluents would exhibit limited variability from the worst
case chemical characteristics. Finally, EPA did not account for the intermittent nature of these
discharges and that they all do not necessarily discharge at the same time. In the analysis, EPA
also considered pollutant parameters with potential additive and/or synergistic effects and
relative persistence in environmental fate and transport (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons).
The result of EPA’s analyses performed pursuant to the Technical Support Document for Water
Quality-based Toxics Control determined that several pollutants of concern (or pollutant
parameters) are or may be discharged at levels that cause, or have the reasonable potential to
cause, or contribute to an excursion above one or more numeric or narrative water quality
standards. Anywhere a numeric effluent limitation was derived, the water quality criterion is
applied as a limit at the point of discharge.
An additional response regarding the comments submitted pertaining to the cumulative impacts
discussed in the EJA are included in Part III.
With regard to changes requested to the final permits for these facilities, refer to Response to
Comment C2, below.
Comment C2:

17

A. The EPA and MassDEP permitting actions should contribute to improved water quality in
the Chelsea River and the draft permits were issued improperly.
As the EPA and MassDEP are well aware, there is an anti-backsliding requirement for NPDES
permits which means that the requirements of a subsequent permit may not be less stringent than
previous permits. The final permits must ensure that discharges from the seven bulk petroleum
terminals (“facilities”) contribute to improving the quality of the receiving waters. Under the
federal and state Clean Water Act, the EPA and MassDEP are required to protect the water
resources of the Commonwealth and may grant permits to industrial dischargers only if the
discharges will conform to regulations. At present, the draft NPDES permits do not conform to
regulations. MassDEP has a broad statutory mandate to protect the waters of the Commonwealth.
M.G.L. c. 21, §§26-53. MassDEP is also responsible for enhancing the quality and value of
water resources, M.G.L. c. 21, §27, and enforcing the anti-degradation provisions of the surface
water quality standards. 314 C.M.R. 4.00.
The Chelsea River water quality is impaired because of pollutants such as petroleum
hydrocarbons and other issues. MassDEP’s federally-approved water quality standards classify
the segment of the Chelsea River in which the facilities are located as Class SB. Class SB waters
are described in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards (314
C.M.R. 4.05(4)(b)) as follows: “These waters are designated as a habitat for fish, other aquatic
life and wildlife, including for their reproduction, migration, growth and other critical functions,
and for primary and secondary contact recreation. In certain waters, habitat for fish, other aquatic
life and wildlife may include, but is not limited to, seagrass…These waters shall have
consistently good aesthetic value.”
A Class SB water body means that the water quality should be able to support wading,
swimming, fishing, boating and a healthy fish and aquatic life community. Yet, the water course
has not achieved this standard. No matter how far away this standard appears, the water quality
should improve, notwithstanding combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, and
marine vessel pollution. The EPA and MassDEP should establish Total Maximum Daily Load
(“TMDL”) criteria for pollutants in the watercourse, as required by the Clean Water Act, which
are essential to achieve the goal of cleaning up the Chelsea River to support recreational
opportunities and improved aquatic habitat.
Because the Chelsea River (Segment 71-06) is an impaired water body,13 permits must not allow
the wastewater discharge of additional pollutants that will contribute to further impairment of
water quality standards. Under §303 of the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §1313, states are
required to set water quality standards for all waters within their boundaries, regardless of the
sources of the pollution entering the waters. Pursuant to §303(d)(1), 33 U.S.C. §1313(d)(1), each
state is required to identify those waters that do not meet the water quality standard, which is
frequently called the “§303(d)(1) list.” For impaired waters identified in the §303(d)(1) list, the
states must establish a TMDL for pollutants identified by the EPA. A TMDL specifies the
maximum amount of pollutants that can be discharged or loaded into the waters from all
combined sources, so as to comply with the water quality standards. Each state is required to

13

18

submit its §303(d)(1) list and its TMDL to the EPA for its approval or disapproval. The state
then incorporates its §303(d)(1) list and its TMDL or the EPA's approved document into its
continuing planning process as required by §303(e), 33 U.S.C. §1313(e).
Under the Clean Water Act, the Chelsea River requires a TMDL, but no TMDL has been
established. The Commonwealth has no TMDL plan for the Chelsea River. Without TMDL
limits, it is impossible to know how the seven facilities will impact water quality in the Chelsea
River or endanger public health and safety. Discharging oil and grease, benzene, benzo(a)pyrene,
naphthalene, lead, and oxygenates into the Chelsea River could endanger public health, safety,
and the environment. Sources of the impairments are identified as aboveground storage tank
leaks from tank farms, bulk petroleum facilities, and the cargo loading and unloading associated
with terminals that are the subject of these comments. The EPA states that the draft permits
sufficiently limit petroleum hydrocarbons and total suspended solids to ensure that discharges do
not cause or contribute to aquatic life impairment. The EPA cannot make this statement because
no Total Maximum Daily Load limits have been set for the Chelsea River. These permits should
not be issued prior to establishment of TMDL limits.
The State of Rhode Island established TMDLs14 for its portion of the Blackstone River, a water
course that has also endured heavy industrial use in the past and the Commonwealth and the EPA
should consider this effort as a model. Furthermore, the Mystic River Watershed Association has
recorded data for Chelsea River, which could help establish a baseline.15 The Commonwealth
has certainly established TMDLs for other water bodies in Massachusetts. It appears all that is
lacking in the effort to establish TMDLs for Chelsea River is a deficit of the political will
necessary to commit the resources required for the task.
Should the EPA and MassDEP disagree with the residents’ position as detailed in these
comments and issue final permits without first approving TMDLs for this section of the Mystic
River Watershed, then the residents respectfully request several changes to the draft permits as
detailed below.




Pollutant scans for each facility outfall should be required quarterly including for ethanol
for facilities that store ethanol. Permittees should be required to conduct pollutant scans,
effluent testing quarterly at regular intervals.
Permittees should be required to conduct whole effluent toxicity testing quarterly at
regular intervals.
All permittees should be required to test for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons monthly at
regular intervals.

Permittees should be required to report immediately to the EPA and MassDEP when they
exceed the total flow rate, maximum daily value for those facilities with a specified
maximum daily value.
Samples should be collected on the outgoing tide or low tide and all facilities should
collect samples on the same day during each reporting quarter. The permittees should be
required to ensure that the sampling reflects conditions under which discharges would
commonly occur. The permit should require that samples be collected on the out-going
tide or at low tide in order to characterize as much as possible Chelsea River water
quality rather than inputs from Boston Harbor. Furthermore, if all seven facilities were
required to sample the River on the same day this would likely provide a more useful data
set for the EPA and MassDEP to evaluate potential impacts of stormwater discharge on
the waterbody.
Facilities should be required to implement best management practices for pre-treating
petroleum hydrocarbons and fuel additives such as ethanol and MTBE.
Facilities should be required to conduct field measurements of pH prior to discharge and
permit discharge only allowed if the water pH is between 6.5 and 8.5 SU. In reviewing
the sampling results from the past five years, in some cases discharges were released to
Chelsea River with pH values as low as 2.96 SU.
If a facility reports a permit exceedance to the EPA and MassDEP, such facility should be
required to increase the frequency of sampling to monthly sampling and prove that they
are meeting permit requirements for six consecutive months before reverting back to
quarterly sampling. It is recommended that in the event that a parameter is above or
outside of the discharge limitation, the facilities would be required to sample and analyze
all discharges until the parameter once again meets the permit requirements. These data
will help characterize the extent of potential impacts of an exceedance as well as identify
systemic failures in the stormwater pollution prevention plan (“SWPPP”) that need to be
addressed.
All facilities should be required to submit a draft SWPPP to the EPA and MassDEP for
approval.
Any permit violation should be reported in the monthly discharge monitoring report and
uploaded to the EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (“ECHO”) website.16
NPDES permits should include conditions regarding the temperature limits of the
effluent.
Permittees should be urged to offer community benefits to the neighboring populations as
discussed below.

In addition to the above recommended special conditions, the EPA and MassDEP should conduct
more frequent unannounced inspections of all seven facilities and issue fines when the facilities
are out of compliance. All seven of the facilities have been out of compliance at least one quarter
during the past five years. To the residents’ knowledge, the EPA did not take any enforcement
action against any terminal operators. More frequent inspections and enforcement actions would
provide a greater incentive for the facility operators to contribute to improving the Chelsea River
water quality. The residents request at least one inspection per facility every six months. If the

EPA and/or MassDEP take enforcement action against one or more of the seven facilities, those
funds should go back into the Chelsea River either through Supplemental Environmental Projects
specifically for the Chelsea River and Mill Creek or lower Mystic River Watershed or that the
funds be directed to the Mystic River Watershed environmental fund housed at The Boston
Foundation. The EPA should establish a publicly accessible web site specifically dedicated to the
Chelsea River and provide up to date information that includes current and past water quality
tests as well as information on NPDES permit violations. In the event of a permit exceedance,
such information should be quickly uploaded to ECHO.
Response to Comment C2:
EPA disagrees that the permits were issued improperly. With respect to anti-backsliding, section
402(o) of the Clean Water Act provides that a NPDES permit may not be re-issued with less
stringent effluent limitations than a previous permit, unless one of a limited number of antibacksliding exceptions are met. 33 United States Code (“U.S.C.”) §1342(o). Since none of the
effluent limitations in the permits are less stringent than previous permits, anti-backsliding
requirements have been met. In fact, the permits contain several more stringent numeric and nonnumeric TBELs. EPA has included these more stringent requirements in meeting provisions of
the Clean Water Act and Massachusetts WQSs such that improvements in water quality of the
Chelsea River are anticipated.
Furthermore, reissuance of these permits does not trigger an anti-degradation review. Antidegradation provisions apply to NPDES permits when a receiving water supports one or more of
its designated uses such that those uses cannot be degraded by an authorized discharge. The
Chelsea River, as described in the fact sheets to the draft permits and repeated in the comment, is
impaired for all of its designated uses as a Class SB waterbody. It has not attained any designated
use and there are no new or increased discharges which could cause further degradation.
Therefore, anti-degradation review is inapplicable here.
Under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, states are required to identify those water segments
where technology-based controls are insufficient to implement the applicable water quality
standards, and which are therefore “water quality limited” or impaired. 33 U.S.C.
§1313(d)(1)(A); 40 C.F.R. §130.2(j). Once a segment is identified as water quality limited, the
state is further required to establish TMDLs, according to a “priority ranking” for impaired
waters, “taking into account the severity of the pollution and the uses to be made of such
waters.” Clean Water Act §303(d)(1)(C), 33 U.S.C. §1313(d)(1)(A), (C); 40 C.F.R. §130.7. A
TMDL is a mathematical approach to allocating the total amount of a pollutant from point
sources, nonpoint sources, and natural background, including a margin of safety, which a water
quality limited segment can tolerate without violating the applicable water quality standards. 40
C.F.R. § 130.2(i). Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires states to develop TMDLs for
waterbodies that will not meet water quality standards after the imposition of TBELs, to ensure
that these waters will come into compliance with water quality standards.
Based on the 2012 303(d) Integrated List of Impaired Waters, MassDEP has completed plans for
478 impaired waterbody segments representing 555 water quality impairments. In addition,
multiple large studies are either complete or underway that will support future TMDL
21

development. Because the major causes of surface water impairment in Massachusetts are
bacteria and excess nutrients, MassDEP places a high priority on developing and implementing
TMDLs for these pollutants.17 Although no TMDLs for the Chelsea River have been finalized as
of the 2012 reporting cycle, MassDEP has completed a draft TMDL to address bacteria
impairment in the Boston Harbor watershed, which includes the Chelsea River (MA71-06).
MassDEP intends to submit the final TMDL to EPA within the next two years. Timelines for
specific TMDLs beyond this two year timeframe have not been established.
In the permits, EPA established numeric effluent limitations under section 122.44(d)(1)(vi). EPA
is not required to wait for establishing a TMDL or wasteload allocation for the Chelsea River to
issue these permits. Similar to the process of developing a TMDL, EPA determined the
assimilative capacity (the loading of pollutant that a water body can assimilate without exceeding
water quality standards). Since there is no allowance for a mixing zone (i.e., no available
dilution) the water quality criterion must be met at the “end-of-pipe”. EPA included WQBELs to
comply with both numeric criteria and narrative criteria. Further, EPA considered all discharges
in the context of available representative ambient data, including data collected by the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, and the permittees, to account for existing impacts and ongoing additive and/or
synergistic effect.18 As previously discussed above, EPA applied a margin of safety to be
protective of human health and the environment.
As the Environmental Appeals Board held in In re Upper Blackstone Water Pollution Abatement
District, “while wasteload allocations may not uniformly be available, effluent limits must be
established without waiting for a TMDL or wasteload allocation”.19 The Board further noted
that, “[t]he regulations specifically contemplate that permit issuers will establish numeric permit
limits when there is no TMDL or wasteload allocation. Subsection (vii) requires the permitting
authority to ‘ensure’ that effluent limits are consistent with “any available wasteload allocation.”
By using the phrase “any available,” the regulations expressly recognize that a TMDL or
wasteload allocation may not be available.”20 In developing appropriate numeric effluent
limitations, EPA further determined that several non-numeric effluent limitations, Best
Management Practices and monitoring requirements were necessary to meet the water quality
goals of the Clean Water Act.
EPA also disagrees with the comment that the reissued permits will not contribute to
improvement in the water quality of the Chelsea River. EPA does not believe any aspect of the
Massachusetts’ 2012303(d) publication, available at
http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dep/water/resources/07v5/12list2.pdf and
Massachusetts’ 2014 proposed 303(d) publication, available at

reissued permits will prevent improvement in receiving water quality. In EPA’s judgment, the
opposite is true: the reissued permits enhance the overall water quality benefit relative to the
previous NPDES permits and ensure compliance with applicable water quality standards. The
reissued permits include more stringent numeric limits, technological, operational, and
implementation controls to address pollutant loading significantly beyond that of the previous
permits and imposes narrative and non-numeric TBELs. EPA included enhanced monitoring and
sampling requirements for both the effluent and receiving water to assess additive and/or
synergistic effects that could exceed WQSs, including biological monitoring with toxicity
testing. The facilities are subject to specific discharge prohibitions (e.g., tank bottom and bilge
water), and requirements for on-going operation and maintenance, including annual inspections
and requirements to ensure that the stormwater collection and treatment system is operated in a
manner that achieves better overall effluent quality than contemplated by the previous permits.
Therefore, EPA believes the reissued permits address the impairments to the Chelsea River more
effectively than the previous permits. These detailed permitting requirements provide EPA and
MassDEP with additional assurance that the discharges from these facilities are being effectively
addressed.
Lastly, EPA notes that both conditions and/or pollutants in the receiving water leading to its
listing as an impaired water are not numeric and/or quantified. Rather, they are narrative and/or
qualitative, as documented in the permits’ fact sheets. EPA reviewed and applied effluent
limitations and/or other conditions (such as Best Management Practices) to meet the narrative
criteria that apply to the Chelsea River.
The designated uses impaired as a result of either “petroleum” or “petroleum hydrocarbons”,
include the Aquatic Life, Aesthetics, Primary Contact and Secondary Contact uses.
Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality Standards do not contain numeric or narrative criteria for
petroleum or petroleum hydrocarbons for Class SB waters. However, the narrative criterion for
toxics at 314 C.M.R. §4.05(5)(e) states, “waters shall be free from pollutants in concentrations or
combinations that are toxic to humans, aquatic life or wildlife”. The pollutant “petroleum
hydrocarbons” consists of many hundreds of individual compounds, the precise combination and
composition of which can vary significantly. Several pollutants or pollutant classes considered
“petroleum hydrocarbons” exhibit toxicity and/or pose a significant environmental or human
health risk. The qualitative analysis completed for the development of the draft permits followed
EPA’s Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control in the absence of
effluent data. In this analysis, EPA determined that limiting indicator parameters would be more
protective and efficient than limiting all the possible individual compounds in “petroleum
hydrocarbons” to meet the narrative criterion for toxics. EPA selected indicator parameters for
pollutants which exhibit physical and/or chemical characteristics strongly representative of other
pollutants in the pollutant class.
As a result, EPA selected the most conservative individual toxicants for which national
recommended criteria exist, as indicator parameters. EPA determined that for the most limiting
parameters, the most stringent applicable criteria were the human health criteria established for
exposure through the consumption of aquatic organisms, as no numeric aquatic life criteria have
been developed for any pollutant of concern. Additionally, the final permits contain several
narrative requirements applicable to all designated uses, including the aquatic life use, based on
23

314 C.M.R. 4.05(5)(e). Monitoring requirements specific to these criteria, and based on the
impairments to the Chelsea River, have also been included, mainly for pollutants for which
monitoring data either have not been collected or insufficient data exist to complete a
quantitative analysis to determine if the concentrations in the discharges cause or have
reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above water quality criteria. Therefore
meeting the effluent limitations for indicator parameters ensures compliance with Massachusetts’
Surface Water Quality Standards.
With regard to the requested changes, EPA agrees that several changes in the final permits are
warranted. Several of the provisions requested were already included in the draft permits. Also
see Response to Comment B2 through Response to Comment B7.

Facilities that store ethanol are required to conduct sampling for ethanol on a quarterly
basis, as requested by the comment. EPA notes that this requirement was included in the
draft permit, under Part I.A., independent of the pollutant scan. EPA further agrees that
the monitoring frequency for the pollutant scan should be increased to quarterly, for a
minimum of the first three years following the effective date of the permit. As noted in
Response to Comment B3, increased sampling frequency improves several factors
affecting data quality. An increased frequency of sampling increases the statistical
confidence with which EPA and MassDEP can determine compliance with the conditions
of the permit and to ensure the permits are sufficiently stringent to meet the requirements
of the Clean Water Act and Massachusetts’ WQSs. Because EPA has increased the
sampling frequency for ambient monitoring requirements under Part I.A. Pollutant Scan,
Receiving Water pursuant to 40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C) and ensure compliance with
Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality Standards at 314 C.M.R. 4.00, and this
requirement is inextricably linked to effluent limitations in the permits, EPA agrees that
an increased sampling frequency for the effluent is warranted, which would improve the
data set and better inform compliance and decision-making for these and other permits in
the Chelsea River watershed in the future. The effluent testing, including the pollutant
scan, are defined at regular intervals for the required frequencies.
As noted in Response to Comment B3 and above, an increased frequency of sampling
increases the statistical confidence with which EPA and MassDEP can determine
compliance with the conditions of the permit and to ensure the permits are sufficiently
stringent to meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act and Massachusetts’ WQSs.
EPA increased the sampling frequency for ambient monitoring requirements under Part
I.A. in Response to Comment B3. Since the Whole Effluent Toxicity Testing Chemical
Analysis requirement is inextricably linked to the testing protocol for the effluent, EPA
agrees that an increased sampling frequency for the effluent is warranted. EPA further
agrees that this increase will improve the data set and better inform compliance and
decision-making for these and other permits in the Chelsea River watershed in the future.
EPA has increased the monitoring frequency for WET testing to quarterly, for a
minimum of the first three years following the effective date of the permit.
EPA has limited polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (“PAHs”), a pollutant class
containing many hundreds of individual compounds, through indicator parameters. The
draft permits established a monthly monitoring frequency for PAHs.

The permittees are required in Part II.D.1.(e) of the NPDES permits to report to EPA
noncompliance, including a non-compliance which may endanger health or the
environment. All seven permits specify a maximum daily flow rate for all permitted
outfalls.
The final permits retain the requirement that the permittees implement a “discharge
practices BMP” that defines conditions which minimize the runoff, run-on and reentrainment of pollutants in the discharge. Further, EPA has required, to the extent
practicable, that facilities sample concurrently, to better quantify potential impacts of
stormwater discharges on the receiving water as described in Response to Comment B2.
Also see Response to Comment B2 regarding enhancements EPA has made to the
discharge practices BMP for discharge and sampling events, as described in Response to
Comment B8.
The final permits retain the requirement for permittees to implement BMPs for the
facilities, including BMPs for fuel oxygenates. All discharges from the facilities receive
treatment prior to entering the receiving water.
The final permits do not include a requirement for field measurements of pH. See
Response to Comment B4.
The final permits do not require an increase in the frequency of sampling to monthly if a
permit exceedance occurs, since all pollutants with numeric effluent limits are already
subject to monthly sampling, except MtBE. Sampling for MtBE remains quarterly as the
additive is no longer in use at any facility. The final permits also retain and include
greater specificity regarding corrective action requirements in the event of several
conditions, including an exceedance of an effluent limitation. See Response to Comment
B5 regarding enhancements EPA has made to the corrective action requirements in
response to comments received. Additional actions required of the permittees following
an exceedance are handled at discretion of EPA Region 1’s Office of Environmental
Stewardship and MassDEP’s enforcement division, as described in Response to
Comment B8.
The final permits do not require permittees to submit a draft SWPPP to EPA and
MassDEP for approval. See Response to Comment B6.
Permittees are already required to report any permit violation in the monthly discharge
monitoring report. Further, once permittees utilize NetDMR for reporting purposes as
required in the permits, an automated notice is generated when the permittee attempts to
enter a value in violation that requires acknowledgement to submit. These data, through
an automated process, are incorporated into EPA’s Enforcement and Compliance History
Online (ECHO) website, which highlights violations for viewing. Further, in the instance
of certain violations defined in Part II of the permits, the permittees must notify EPA
within specified timeframes.
The final permits do not include temperature limits. See Response to Comment C3.
EPA urges permittees to offer community benefits to the neighboring populations as
discussed in the comment. See Comment C5 and Response to Comment C5.

Lastly, EPA and MassDEP have many enforcement options available when violations of the
Clean Water Act are discovered. EPA can issue an administrative order to a facility to comply,
assess an administrative penalty or refer the case to the Department of Justice for a judicial
action seeking a penalty and/or injunctive relief. Finally, if the facility or its employees willfully
25

acted in violation of the Clean Water Act, EPA can pursue criminal charges. The EPA and the
MassDEP may use their enforcement discretion to determine the appropriate enforcement
approach to be used after taking into account such factors as the type of problem identified,
frequency of occurrence and the responsiveness of the facility in resolving and addressing the
problem. The status of potential as well as ongoing enforcement actions are reviewed at least
quarterly by EPA staff. In the event of a settlement, an alleged violator may voluntarily agree to
undertake an environmentally beneficial project or Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP)
related to the violation in exchange for mitigation of the penalty to be paid. EPA has no authority
to require that an SEP be included in the settlement. In many instances SEPs involve projects
which occur in the community where a facility is located and these projects can therefore have a
more direct and tangible benefit to the local community. EPA Region 1 has participated in
settlements which include SEPs and would consider the use of future SEPs as long as they meet
certain legal requirements and furthers EPA’s goal of protecting and enhancing public health and
the environment.
Inspections of facilities with NPDES permits are performed by EPA Region 1’s Office of
Environmental Stewardship. EPA’s Office of Site Remediation and Restoration also regularly
inspects the bulk fuel storage facilities for their compliance with the Oil Pollution Act.
Additionally, these facilities are inspected by MassDEP. EPA’s inspection frequency depends on
such factors as the regulatory requirements of the program, the compliance history of the facility,
the EPA resources available to perform inspections and the extent of competing environmental
priorities. Monitoring results, are reviewed with the goal of prioritizing inspections as well as for
resolving any violations identified in a timely manner. EPA attempts to take all of the above
factors into account when developing an appropriate inspection frequency and therefore cannot
commit to an inspection frequency of one inspection per facility every six months as requested in
the comment.
Monitoring requirements under the NPDES permitting program are designed to be “selfimplementing” and “self-reporting”. This means that the permittee is accountable for all aspects
of the work to ensure compliance, including the selecting of contractors, paying for the work that
is performed, and ensuring that such work is conducted and properly reported to the appropriate
permitting authority. The Clean Water Act specifically authorizes self-reporting through
Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs). Permitting authorities in turn load monitoring data into
the Integrated Compliance and Information System (ICIS), which is then uploaded into EPA’s
Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) website21. Interested persons can access
compliance data submitted by the facilities through ECHO. EPA, MassDEP and other federal
agencies also provide information regarding the status of waterbodies throughout the United
States (e.g., Assessed Waters of Massachusetts by Watershed website22, available water quality
assessment reports23, and the MyWATERS Mapper for EPA’s Office of Water program data,
including the National Hydrography Dataset24. EPA Region 1 also maintains a dedicated website

information provided to the public through the Informational Meeting on June 24, 2013 and the
Informational Meeting and Public Hearing on April 17, 2014.
With regard to access to information pertaining to these permits online, EPA established a
dedicated website for these facilities for the NPDES process.26 Information available elsewhere,
such as the status of the receiving water and TMDLs is not duplicated.
EPA and MassDEP will continue to employ compliance assurance, incentives, monitoring and
enforcement to ensure that permitted facilities comply with their permit requirements.
Also see Response to Comment B8.
Comment C3:
B. The EPA and MassDEP permitting actions should evaluate climate change impacts and
make changes before issuing final permits to incorporate foreseeable climate change
impacts.
In addition to the reasons discussed above, the draft NPDES permits are inadequate because of
their failure to consider climate change impacts. Section 316(a) of the Clean Water Act requires
the EPA to consider the change to the ambient water temperature in the Chelsea River because of
an effluent discharge. The EPA must revise the NPDES permits for all seven facilities to
consider that the effects of global climate change could alter the thermal profile of the Chelsea
River and Sales Creek. Historical conditions of the thermal profile of the Chelsea River do not
necessarily predict future conditions. Since some of the water for the seven facilities originates
as boiler blowdown from steam boilers, the NPDES permits should include conditions regarding
the temperature of the effluent. As water temperature increases, water pollution problems will
increase. As the temperature of water increases, dissolved oxygen levels will decrease. These
more complex environmental conditions should be evaluated by the EPA. The NPDES permit
limits should reflect these foreseeable climate changes and increases in temperature of the
Chelsea River and Sales Creek.
Further, the NPDES permits are jointly issued by the EPA and the Department of Environmental
Protection. Under state law, MassDEP is required to consider reasonably foreseeable climate
change impacts before issuing the permits under M.G.L. c. 30, §61, ¶ 2.27 MEPA Section 61, as
amended by the Global Warming Solutions Act, states in paragraph one that “[a]ny
determination made by an agency of the Commonwealth shall include a finding describing the
environmental impact, if any, of the project and a finding that all feasible measures have been
taken to avoid or minimize said impact.” M.G.L. c. 30, §61, ¶ 1. The second paragraph goes on
to say “[i]n considering and issuing permits . . . the respective agency, department . . . shall also
consider reasonable foreseeable climate change impacts” (emphasis added). M.G.L. c. 30, §61, ¶
2. The use of the term “also,” by its plain meaning, indicates the legislators’ intent for the agency
to make findings and also consider reasonably foreseeable climate change impacts. The draft

Response to Comment C3:
Section 502(6) of the Clean Water Act defines heat as a “pollutant.” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(6).
Therefore, thermal effluent, such as cooling water or boiler blowdown, is considered a pollutant,
and such discharges require a NPDES permit. Only one of the seven facilities at issue generates
boiler blowdown, Chelsea Sandwich Terminal, LLC, necessitated by the storage of No. 6 fuel
oil, the viscosity of which can be affected by ambient temperatures. The boiler blowdown enters
the stormwater conveyance system, comingles with stormwater and groundwater remediation
effluent, and receives treatment through the oil/water separator prior to entering the Chelsea
River. Based on the proportion of boiler blowdown relative to the total volume of effluent, the
configuration of the stormwater conveyance system and expected retention times, the
temperature noted for the effluent in the permittee’s NPDES permit renewal application, and
ambient temperature data collected by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority,28 EPA
determined no measurable thermal effluent is discharged to the Chelsea River from this facility.
In consideration of this comment, temperature was evaluated during the summer when a heated
discharge would be of most concern. EPA requested additional temperature monitoring data and
information regarding the generation of boiler blowdown from the facility, which was provided
by the permittee on July 28, 2014. The boiler blowdown is generated as a liquid condensate and
to some extent, steam. Boiler blowdown is generated by boiler number 1 at a rate and typical
total of 25 gallons per day. Boiler blowdown is generated by boiler number 2 at a rate and typical
total of 30 gallons per day. The maximum daily volume if boiler blowdown is discharged from
both boilers is typically 55 gallons up to a reported maximum of 200 gallons per day. The
operating temperature of the boilers ranges from 100 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which is
equivalent to the maximum possible temperature of boiler blowdown. The temperature of the
boiler blowdown effluent upon mixing at the point it enters the stormwater conveyance system
was recorded at 84 and 92 degrees Fahrenheit in July 2014. The temperature of the stormwater
and groundwater remediation effluent prior to comingling with boiler blowdown was recorded at
73.3 degrees Fahrenheit. The storage capacity of the oil/water separator is 10,000 gallons. The
temperature of the comingled effluents in the oil/water separator was recorded at 74.4 degrees
Fahrenheit. This temperature neither exceeds the applicable water quality criterion for
temperature of a Class SB waterbody, 85 degrees Fahrenheit, nor does this temperature
demonstrate a change in temperature of more than 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (applicable July
through September) even before mixing with ambient water.
To evaluate any potential thermal impact to the Chelsea River that would exceed applicable
water quality criteria, EPA considered ambient conditions during development of the draft
permits. The temperature of the Chelsea River has ranged from 16.18 degrees Celsius (61.1
degrees Fahrenheit) to 24.74 degrees Celsius (76.5 degrees Fahrenheit) in July (i.e., when
ambient surface water temperatures are highest) since 2000 (i.e., a time period shortened to
account for likely increases in average surface water temperatures due to climate change). The

Chelsea River holds an average 276,520,753 cubic feet of water.29 Even if EPA overestimates
the thermal impact by calculating an instream temperature using only the upstream critical low
flow contribution to Chelsea River, 0.055 million gallons per day, at the maximum temperature
of the Chelsea River recorded since 2000, 76.5 degrees Fahrenheit,30 10,000 gallons of effluent
discharged at 74.4 degrees does not exceed 85 degrees Fahrenheit and will not raise the
temperature of the Chelsea River 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit or more.31 Furthermore, even the direct
discharge of 200 gallons per day of boiler blowdown at the maximum 170 degrees Fahrenheit,
which is technically not possible given the facility configuration, does not exceed 85 degrees
Fahrenheit and will not raise the temperature of the Chelsea River 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit or
more.32 Therefore, EPA maintains that no thermal limits are necessary to meet Massachusetts’
WQSs for temperature for a Class SB waterbody. No boiler blowdown or other thermal effluent
is generated at any of the remaining six facilities which discharges to the Chelsea River.
The Massachusetts General Law noted in the comment containing the requirement to consider
reasonably foreseeable climate change is commonly referred to as MEPA. Pursuant to M.G.L. c.
30, §61 review thresholds, defined in the MEPA regulations at 301 C.M.R. 11.03, MEPA review
is required when one or more review thresholds are met or exceeded and the subject matter of at
least one review threshold is within MEPA jurisdiction. However, as specifically exempted in
301 C.M.R. 11.02(2), “for purposes of review thresholds, [a] Permit shall not be considered to
include… a permit, license, certificate, variance, or approval to continue a preexisting lawful use
on a Project site, or amendments or extensions thereof”. As the permits are being reissued to
continue a pre-existing lawful use, the MEPA review threshold is not applicable, and therefore
the requirement in the MEPA statute to consider reasonably foreseeable climate change does not
apply.
Nevertheless, EPA does consider foreseeable climate change impacts in the reissuance of
NPDES permits as such impacts are relevant to the EPA’s authority under the NPDES program.
The factors to consider are documented in EPA’s NPDES Permit Writer’s Manual, Sections
5.2.2.7 and 6.2.4.2. Regarding Section 5.2.2.7, a thermal variance under Clean Water Act Section
316(a) is not appropriate to the facility generating boiler blowdown nor is a 316(b) variance
needed since the thermal discharge does not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality
standards. Regarding Section 6.2.4.2, the 7Q10 calculation period of record is also not applicable
as EPA has not allowed a dilution factor in consideration of any upstream flow contribution.
Rather than reduce the available flow under critical low flow conditions, which would result in a

lowering of allowable dilution, where water quality based limits apply, these limits are applied at
the end-of-pipe for all facilities, including the facility that generates boiler blowdown.
Finally, as the commenter has correctly noted, changes in the ambient thermal profile can alter
the toxic effect of certain pollutants. EPA reiterates the importance of incorporating monitoring
requirements for multiple pollutants considered during permit development. For example, EPA
added monitoring requirements for ammonia, in conjunction with Whole Effluent Toxicity
Testing, the toxicity of which increases as the temperature and pH increase.



How do the permits account for the testing of incidental release quantities of pollutants as
compared with the required testing of treated stormwater?
The environmental and public health burden of these seven facilities are not measured by
stormwater reports. How does the EPA fully evaluate the facilities impacts to the
surrounding environmental justice populations and communities?
All seven bulk petroleum terminals were issued draft permits simultaneously. Did EPA
and MassDEP consider each of the facility’s discharge in isolation or consider all seven
facilities’ discharge holistically?
How did the EPA and MassDEP determine effluent limits and parameters in a way that

What is the plan and timeline for establishing TMDLs for the Chelsea River?

Response to Comment C4:


How do the permits account for the testing of incidental release quantities of pollutants as
compared with the required testing of treated stormwater?

NPDES permits generally contain effluent limitations, monitoring and reporting requirements,
standard conditions, and special conditions such as Best Management Practices (BMPs), if
appropriate), to ensure that the goals of the Clean Water Act are met. If there is a direct spill or
release to the surface water, that incident is beyond the scope of the NPDES permit. The Coast
Guard enforces Section 311 (33 U.S.C. §1321) for oil spills (Section 311 is also known as the Oil
Pollution Act) for coastal waters and ports. However, the facilities are subject to the Spill
Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Rule implemented by EPA’s Emergency
Management Program.
The effluent limitations and requirements in the permits are designed to control any pollutant that
comes into contact with any effluent at the facilities. This is especially important for stormwater,
as it is the largest volume of effluent discharged at all seven facilities by volume. The permits
specifically prohibit any discharge following accidental release of reportable quantities of
petroleum products and include specific restrictions for bypass of the treatment systems at the
facilities in the event of an emergency. The facilities are further required to implement Best
30

Management Practices that prevent contact between any accidental spills or releases with any of
the effluent authorized in the permits.


How does the EPA fully evaluate the facilities impacts to the surrounding environmental
justice populations and communities?

Under the scope of the Clean Water Act, EPA considers impacts to any receptor as a result of
discharge from permitted outfalls, whether a resident of the surrounding communities or an
aquatic organism. Limits are developed based on the designated uses in the receiving water and
the water quality criteria Massachusetts has determined are necessary to protect designated uses
and the related receptors. The permits include stringent numeric effluent limitations based on
human health criteria and conservatively exclude dilution in the receiving water. These limits
apply to all effluent discharged from these facilities. EPA believes the limitations and
requirements in the permit address, to the extent allowable under EPA’s authority under the
Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations, impacts to human health and the environment
that have been reasonably ascertained from the available information for the effluent, the
receiving water, the surrounding environmental justice communities and discharges from similar
facilities. The overall burden on the surrounding communities of these facilities, including
pollutant loading beyond the context of point source discharges regulated under the NPDES
program, is discussed in the EJA. EPA considered the information documented in the EJA during
permit development and incorporated requirements necessary to protect human health and the
environment. Also see Response to Comments related to the EJA, included in Part III.


Did EPA and MassDEP consider each of the facility’s discharge in isolation or consider
all seven facilities’ discharge holistically?

EPA considered these permits not in isolation, but rather, in the context of all potential direct
dischargers (including other petroleum bulk stations and terminals) of light and heavy
hydrocarbons, which discharge either directly into Chelsea River or indirectly (via tributaries or
hydrologic connection). EPA also accounted for possible non-point source contributions by
evaluating the presence of the pollutants of concern in the receiving water. The final permits are
conditioned to: 1) better regulate plausible non-stormwater discharges (e.g., hydrostatic test
water and groundwater remediation system effluent) alone or in combination with stormwater
runoff to Chelsea River, and 2) to better regulate ancillary operations that have the potential to
contact stormwater (e.g., materials storage, facility site-runoff, product blending, and product
loading and unloading). EPA’s approach follows guidance in EPA’s Technical Support
Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control and generally aligns with the analysis
recommended in EPA’s Watershed-Based National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) Permitting Technical Guidance. See Response to Comment C1.


How did the EPA and MassDEP determine effluent limits and parameters in a way that
accounted for similar discharges by the other six facilities?

As discussed in Response to Comment C2, EPA completed a reasonable potential analysis in
accordance with EPA’s Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control
which includes factors pertaining to multiple sources. EPA also ensured that all seven facilities
31

are required to meet a suite of identical requirements and additionally incorporated site-specific
conditions where appropriate. In addition, the effluent limitations that are water quality-based are
applied at the end-of-pipe (i.e., no allowable dilution).

traveling to and from the oil terminals, improvements to public access areas, wetlands restoration
funds, funds for an attorney and/or scientist and/or engineer to explain effluent sampling results
and legal implications, and multilingual signs placed at public access points along the Chelsea
River indicating the impaired water quality status and restrictions on recreation. These seven
facilities easily have funds to make the bulk petroleum facilities safer and less of an
environmental and public health burden. As noted in the EJA, the affected populations have
excess cardiovascular death rates, which can be partially addressed. Facility operator funds
should be invested in diesel particulate filters for the delivery trucks traveling to and from the
facilities to reduce air emissions, which would lessen the negative health impacts of exposure to
truck emissions associated with the seven facilities. Additionally, funds could be contributed
toward the other community benefits listed above.
In conclusion, the communities that abut the seven bulk petroleum facilities and Chelsea River
face not only an environmental justice burden but also a pollution burden of historical
proportions. Simply put, many residents have lived beside or near a water body that has been
polluted for a very long time. The final NPDES permits, if issued, should acknowledge this fact
and incorporate the aforementioned suggested changes so that conditions in the Chelsea River
and in the surrounding area can improve and contribute to environmental justice in Chelsea, East
Boston, and Revere. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
Response to Comment C5:
As noted in Response to Comment C2 above, EPA urges the permittees to consider the
commenters’ suggestions. EPA also encourages the communities to seek funding for the control
measures, public access and restoration and educational activities through appropriate state and
federal programs or by working directly with the permittees. EPA has used its authority under
the Clean Water Act to incorporate appropriate limits and conditions sufficiently connected to
water quality impacts or technology-based limitations. It is not clear to EPA how the community
benefits requested are connected to water quality impacts or technology-based limitations. Nor
has the commenter provided such an explanation. While the request pertaining to wetlands
restoration may be related to water quality impacts, without more specific information as to a
description, location, and need for a particular project, such a request is too vague for EPA to
evaluate at this time. EPA notes, however, wetlands restoration may be appropriate in the context
of a suitable enforcement action, such as a SEP. See Response to Comment C2 for additional
information regarding SEPs.

EPA acknowledges the environmental justice communities which surround the permitted
facilities as well as the documented legacy pollution both at the permitted facilities and in the
Chelsea River. Considerable effort has been expended to ensure that EPA has considered all
known or suspected pollutants discharged under authorization of these permits. EPA has also
expended considerable effort to ensure that the communities have been afforded meaningful
involvement in the permitting action. EPA has thoroughly considered the comments received
from ACE, submitted on behalf of the communities, and has incorporated the majority of
changes to the final permits that ACE requested in Comment C2.
EPA requested clarification from ACE regarding the request for the permittees to fund a
technical expert to explain monitoring results to the public. (A related request is included in
Comment J1). ACE responded by providing an NPDES permit issued by the State of
Washington to City of Spokane Riverside Park Water Reclamation Facility and by referring to
the Wheelabrator facility in Saugus, Massachusetts, which, according to ACE, pays a consultant
to review and interpret its air quality reports for the local Board of Health. ACE did not explain,
however, the particular purpose to be achieved by such independent data interpretation in the
case of these NPDES permits. In both of the examples provided, the technical expert funding
arrangement appears to have arisen through negotiations with the facilities outside of permitting
actions. In the case of the Wheelabrator facility, the current state-issued air permit does not
appear to be the source of any such requirement. According to MassDEP, a settlement agreement
required Wheelabrator to hire an independent environmental auditor to monitor the company’s
compliance with environmental regulations for a period of three years but does not provide
services directly to the public. However, unrelated to this agreement and the permit, an
additional consultant hired by the local communities periodically reviews Wheelabrator’s files
and reports to the local communities. In the NPDES permit example issued by the State of
Washington, the technical consultant included in the permit appears to have been included to
align with an agreement outside of the permit process.33 The permittee-initiated voluntary
arrangement appears to have developed in response to efforts to identify the sources of PCB
contamination in the Spokane River and was apparently aimed, at least in part, at educating the
public to reduce the use of products containing PCBs that could make their way to the river via
wastewater sent to the permittee – a publicly owned wastewater treatment facility.
In the case of these NPDES permits, however, it is not clear to EPA the specific purpose that
would be served by requiring independent review and interpretation of monitoring data or that
such a requirement is needed to ensure compliance, nor did ACE provide further clarification of
the particular purpose to be achieved. The final permits currently require the permittees to
provide EPA and DEP with discharge monitoring reports (“DMRs”) and other mandatory reports
(including Hydrostatic Test Summary Letter/Report, and Toxicity Test Results) on a timely
basis. Once permittees begin using NetDMR for reporting purposes, as required in the permits,
an automated notice will be generated when the permittee attempts to enter a value in violation
that requires acknowledgement to submit. These data are automatically incorporated into EPA’s
Enforcement and Compliance History Online (“ECHO”) website, 34 which highlights violations
for viewing. Further, in the instance of certain violations defined in Part II of the permits, the
33
34

See Spokane River Regional Toxics Task Force Final Memorandum of Agreement at http://srrttf.org/.
Currently accessed at: http://www.epa-echo.gov/echo/

33

permittees are required to notify EPA within specified timeframes for certain conditions. The
permits also require the facilities to maintain their Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans
(“SWPPPs”) and annual certifications onsite and to make them available upon request to EPA,
MassDEP, and/or the city in which the facility is located. EPA and MassDEP evaluate
compliance through inspections of the facilities and review of the submitted monitoring data and
other reports and routinely coordinate compliance and enforcement activities. The final permits
also require the permittees to provide a summary of discharge monitoring report data and copies
of their SWPPPs to the public by posting these data on the company’s own website, if
practicable. Additionally, agency staff field inquiries from the public regarding compliance
issues and any person may report suspected environmental violations to EPA.35
NPDES regulations do not require permittees to engage in community outreach and education to
the extent requested. Consequently, EPA has decided as a matter of discretion not to include a
requirement to fund a technical expert. EPA strongly urges the permittees, however, to consider
the commenter’s suggestions and encourages the permittees to undertake voluntary outreach
efforts to improve the relationships between the facilities and their communities. EPA regards
such voluntary efforts as incentive factors to consider on a case-by-case basis under EPA’s
Interim Guidance for Performance-Based Reduction of NPDES Permit Monitoring Frequencies
in the event monitoring frequency reductions are requested. EPA also notes that community
outreach and supplemental environmental projects may occasionally be negotiated as part of a
settlement agreement between the Agencies and the permittees in the event of an enforcement
action. Some public notification is required of permittees conducting certain activities or under
certain circumstances under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (see 310 C.M.R. 40.0000).
While not relevant to these permits, nearby communities may also receive public notification
benefits from permittees subject to the nine minimum control measures aligned with EPA’s
National CSO Control Policy (59 FR 18688), provisions of the Massachusetts Water Resources
Authority’s monitoring programs, or public participation requirements associated with the
National Pretreatment program for certain Publicly-Owned Treatment Works receiving
pollutants from significant industrial sources.

EPA appreciates the long-term efforts of these organizations to improve water quality of the
Chelsea River and their work to achieve environmental justice for the communities. Please see
Response to Comment C1 through Response to Comment C6 regarding the comments submitted
separately by ACE.
This comment also appears in Part III., below.
Comments submitted by Salvatore LaMattina, Boston City Councilor, District One:
Comment E1:
As the City Councilor who represents the neighborhood of East Boston, I felt it necessary to
write to you and express some of my concerns over the reissuing of permits to seven different
bulk petroleum storage facilities located along the Chelsea River. As you know, my
neighborhood directly abuts the river and would be severely impacted by any potential
environmental disasters that may occur. We already feel the negative effects of pollution created
by the existence of Logan Airport and three harbor tunnels, so I feel that it’s only fair that we be
kept informed as to what improvements will be made to insure us of our safety.
To start, are there plans to clean up the Chelsea River and maintain its cleanliness? And I ask this
not just for the sake of my constituents, but for the impact on wildlife and aquatic life, aesthetics
and overall recreational use of the river. I know that the draft permits limit the amount of contact
with stormwater that the pollutants may have, but we would just like some reassurance that 1)
the companies will comply and that strong enforcement will be in place if they don’t; and 2) who
will be supervising and monitoring them?
Second, given the poor performance of some facilities in the past, what will be demanded of
them if they do not remain up to par? We in East Boston feel that much more should be asked of
these companies to contribute to the overall health of the neighborhood to mitigate the great
burden that they may cause. At the very least, a fund could be established to put in reserve for
large asks in case we need any help or improvements.
Lastly, not only am I the elected official for this neighborhood but I am also the Chair of the
Committee on Economic Development & Planning & Labor for the Boston City Council. After
decades of desolation, the waterfront and inner harbor are finally starting to see some
revitalization. My fear is twofold, that developers would shy away from building in what could
potentially be a “danger zone” and that the housing and rental market would be stifled because
residents would be afraid to move to the community. So again, any reassurance you can provide
would be greatly appreciated.
35

In closing, all that we are asking is that these companies continue to be good neighbors and
practice full transparency in compliance with the Clean Water Act. We want to make sure that
adherence to the regulations is their number one priority, in word and action. There are too many
cities and towns surrounding Chelsea Creek and we don’t want to take any chances. Thank you
for your time and attention to this matter.
Response to Comment E1:
NPDES permits are not specifically designed or intended to address environmental disasters,
which EPA takes to mean emergency or catastrophic releases. Several EPA programs and
multiple local, state and federal entities beyond EPA assume primary responsibility for such
situations. Also see Response to Comment C4.
With regard to the status of pollution levels and attainment of water quality standards (i.e.,
“cleanliness”) of the Chelsea River, refer to Response to Comment C2 and Response to
Comment C4. EPA has also identified a number of ongoing activities, apart from the NPDES
permits, that address the cleanup of existing contamination in and adjacent to the Chelsea River.
For example, existing contamination in soil or groundwater, is being or has been addressed
primarily through the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (301 C.M.R. 40.0000) at each of the
seven facilities. Removal actions continue at several nearby sites under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (commonly known as “Superfund”).
Contaminated sites also continue to be assessed, cleaned up and re-developed through EPA's
Brownfields Program in this area.
In terms of maintaining the “cleanliness” of Chelsea River, several state programs exist to
prevent additional degradation of the River. Massachusetts General Law Chapter 91,
implemented by MassDEP, Massachusetts Coastal Zone Management, and Massachusetts
Division of Marine Fisheries, among others, regulates activities related to construction, dredging
and filling in and around the Chelsea River, preserves and protects the rights of the public, and
guarantees that private uses of tidelands and waterways serve a proper public purpose. So, for
example, if a facility repairs or replaces its seawall containment structure, any contamination is
managed. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains the Chelsea River as one of the nation’s
navigational channels. This includes periodic maintenance dredging (i.e., the depth of the
channel is maintained to at least 38 feet, as currently mandated) and improvement dredging (i.e.,
the depth of the channel is increased). In dredging activities, contaminated sediment is managed.
Previous maintenance dredging completed in the Chelsea River removed contaminated sediment
to Confined Aquatic Disposal (“CAD”) cells constructed in the Mystic River. EPA is also a
cooperating agency for the Boston Harbor Deep Draft Navigation Improvement Project.
Information regarding activities conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Boston
Harbor is available on the corps website.36
While direct cleanup activities have or will continue to occur, water quality improvements to
protect all designated uses for the Chelsea River and human health for adjacent neighborhoods,
including East Boston, also continue. In addition to source reduction through point source
36

http://www.nae.usace.army.mil/Missions/ProjectsTopics/BostonHarbor.aspx

36

control in these permits, non-point source controls are addressed through MS4 permits for
stormwater. All permits issued under the Clean Water Act contain provisions for the protection
of water quality, including human health criteria, where applicable.
EPA and MassDEP will continue to employ all of the tools available to both Agencies (e.g.,
enforcement, inspections, compliance assurance, and monitoring) to ensure that permitted
facilities comply with their permit requirements. As discussed in EPA’s response to Comment
C2, EPA can pursue civil as well as criminal penalties for facilities that fail to comply with their
permit and violate the Clean Water Act. Under the Clean Water Act, EPA can seek a civil
penalty of up to $37,500 per day for each violation. Penalties collected as a result of an
enforcement action under the Clean Water Act go to the U.S. Treasury. As described in
Response to Comment C2, above, in the event of a settlement, an alleged violator may
voluntarily agree to undertake an environmentally beneficial project or SEP related to the
violation in exchange for mitigation of the penalty to be paid. EPA has no authority to require
that an SEP be included in the settlement. EPA Region 1 would consider the use of future SEPs
as long as they meet certain legal requirements and furthers EPA’s goal of protecting and
enhancing public health and the environment. EPA also encourages communities to seek funding
through other appropriate state and federal programs for other local projects which could benefit
the community.
The Permittee is required to certify at least annually that the Terminal is in compliance with the
SWPPP. If the Terminal is not in compliance with any aspect of the SWPPP, including
implementation of BMPs, the annual certification shall state the non-compliance and the
remedies which are being undertaken. The Permittee must also certify, at least annually, that the
previous year’s inspections and maintenance activities were conducted, results recorded, records
maintained, and that the Terminal is in compliance with this permit.
With regard to monitoring, the permittees self-monitor and report their results to EPA and
MassDEP. The Agencies oversee the facility’s compliance with permit limitations and
conditions. The permittees are required to collect representative samples and use a certified
analytical laboratory to test the samples. Sample test results are recorded on Discharge
Monitoring Reports (“DMRs”) which must be submitted by the 15th of the month following the
sampling event. EPA and MassDEP may review the data, audit the labs, and/or perform random
inspections, during which they can take their own samples.
EPA agrees that transparency and assuring compliance are important components of the NPDES
permitting program. EPA is working to enhance transparency and compliance as well as the
quality of the data being reported by facilities by requiring electronic reporting through the use
of NetDMR. NetDMR is a web-based tool that allows facilities to electronically report their
DMRs to EPA through a secure internet connection. All newly issued NPDES permits in
Massachusetts and New Hampshire have the use of NetDMR as a permit requirement and many
of the bulk fuel terminals along Chelsea River have voluntarily begun using NetDMR. NetDMR
is intended to improve the accuracy of the data submitted as well as speed up how quickly the
data is made available to EPA for review. Having quicker access to the data also means more
timely compliance determinations made by EPA as well as reported to the public through ECHO.
Given the benefits of electronic reporting, EPA has shortened the timeframe for how long a
37

facility has to begin using NetDMR from twelve (12) months to six (6) months. Several of the
permitted facilities already use NetDMR. Finally, the final permits include additional disclosure
requirements for the permittees to provide discharge monitoring data and copies of their
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans to the public. Also see Response to Comment C5.
Additional authority concerning prevention and response to releases of hazardous materials rests
with state and local governments. The Emergency Planning Community Right-to-Know Act
(EPCRA) of 1986, 37 which was created to help communities plan for emergencies involving
hazardous substances, generally requires hazardous chemical emergency planning by federal,
state, local and tribal governments, and industries. Industrial facilities are required to report the
storage, use and release of hazardous chemicals. EPCRA requires the establishment of
State/Tribe Emergency Response Commissions (SERCs/TERCs), responsible for coordinating
certain emergency response activities and for appointing Local Emergency Planning Committees
(LEPCs). Each state’s SERC is responsible for implementing the EPCRA provisions within its
state. The Massachusetts SERC is located within the Massachusetts Emergency Management
Agency (MEMA). The SERC's duties include: establishing procedures for receiving and
processing public requests for information collected under EPCRA; reviewing local emergency
response plans; designating local emergency planning districts; appointing a Local Emergency
Planning Committees (LEPC) for each district; and supervising the activities of the LEPC.
LEPCs, created by a state’s Governor, develop emergency response plans, review those plans at
least annually, and provide chemical information to citizens. Plans are developed by LEPCs with
stakeholder participation. There is one LEPC for each of the more than 3,000 designated local
emergency planning districts. The LEPC membership must include (at a minimum): elected state
and local officials; police, fire, civil defense, and public health professionals; environment,
transportation, and hospital officials; facility representatives; and representatives from
community groups and the media.
Many LEPCs have expanded their activities beyond the requirements of EPCRA, encouraging
accident prevention and risk reduction, and addressing homeland security in their communities.
Composed of representatives from all segments of the community interested in emergency
planning and preparedness, LEPCs foster a valuable dialogue among members of the public,
industry and government. In some communities LEPCs have formally aligned themselves with
FEMA’s Citizen Corps Program. Further, Chelsea’s LEPC has produced a Hazard Mitigation
Plan,38 which is a proactive effort to identify actions that reduce the risk to life and property
from natural hazard events, such as flooding. The Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000
requires all municipalities that wish to be eligible to receive FEMA grant funding for hazard
mitigation, to adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan and update this plan in five year
intervals. These plans increasingly include climate mitigation planning.

Matthew Frank. I'm president of the Chelsea City Council. Welcome, EPA and DEP to my
chambers.
My concern is, I am not sure if the cumulative effects of each of the seven terminals is being
taken into account. I do understand that, if you regulate each one, then, in theory that would
work out. But, if you have seven, and they're all discharging the maximum amount, I do have a
concern that it could lead to way too much. The same way that one person speaking with their
indoor voices, as those in the education field would say, is fine. But, if everybody in this room
started speaking kind of in that rabble, rabble way that sometimes people do, it becomes
unbearable and you can't hear what's going on.
I also do have concern about the Environmental Justice half mile assessment. I represent a
district in the city over near, I generally say, between the Home Depot, the wind turbine, and the
water tank up at Soldier's Home. And I know Sue is one of my constituents. We're not within the
half mile radius. But, we are on the Mill Creek, which comes off of the Chelsea Creek. And
anything that happens in the Chelsea Creek goes up the Mill Creek right into that neighborhood.
We have many under water waterways that run underneath the neighborhood. The flooding of
my basement every time it rains kind of help proves that. Even if the sump pump is going full
blast, there's always water down there, because the water's running through. Because it used to
be the clay pits as most people in this room remember. So, that is a concern of mine, that we
actually have four buildings in my neighborhood right on the creek that house people who have
they're -- that are run by the housing authority. So, the big red building at that end, at the very
end of Clark Ave. We also have a lot of low income residents right on the Creek, including a
minority population, of Latino descent. I know, there's also a lot of white people in my
neighborhood. But, we do have a minority population specifically on the Chelsea Creek itself.
I would say there is a concern that the permitting process doesn't include accidents that happened
outside of that one particular pipe. So, if oil gets spilled in the transferring process, it's my
understanding that the permits don’t include anything that is happening outside of what they're
putting into the pipe and that's going into the water.
The last thing I would say, and that would -- it might not be completely relevant. But, one of the
concerns I've always had as a member of the planning board, then a member of the council, and
now as president, is, people often say to me, why do we need to have these seven oil tanks? Why
do we need all of this industrial use on the waterfront? I personally get asked all the time why I
let that happen. And my concern is, I let that happen because we can't do anything else. The state
tells us this has to be maritime use, specifically where these tanks are, it has to be maritime
industrial use because of a state regulation. And that's a real concern of mine, because we try to
clean up the creek. And we've done so -- we pull carriages out of the water. I've personally been
up to my knees pulling stuff out of the creek. And no matter what we do, we still end up with oil
tanks on the creek. We still end up with pollution coming into the community. And I realize that
the limits have been reduced in some of these new permits. But, it's still happening. And when
you've got seven, my hope is that we can at least -- that's something in the future we can push
away.

39

But, in the meantime, I would like to see gradual movement, the same way that the auto
regulations are pushed 20 or 30 years into the future, we already kind of know what the federal
government wants in 20 or 30 years. My hope is that we can build a timeline for things like these
permits that say, okay. Well, today, technology will only allow, you know, five – milligrams per
liter. But, maybe in five years, it could be four. And with the hope that we could push facilities to
get to zero.
But, thank you so much. Like I said, welcome again.
Response to Comment F1:
With regard to the commenter’s concerns pertaining to the cumulative effect of pollutants
authorized in the permits, refer to Response to Comment C1, and Response to Comment C4.
EPA has taken into account the cumulative effects of these discharges through the development
of these permits under the Clean Water Act as necessary to ensure discharges comply with
Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality Standards.
With regard to the Environmental Justice half-mile assessment, see Response to Comment C6.
This comment also appears in Part III., below.
With regard to the commenter’s reference to maritime industrial use, both the Chelsea River and
the Mystic River (the area in which the Chelsea Sandwich facility is located) are Designated Port
Areas (“DPAs”) established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All matters of oversight
pertaining to the DPA are beyond the scope of the NPDES permit program. The Massachusetts
Office of Coastal Zone Management (“MassCZM”) addresses these designations. MassCZM has
generally defined DPA’s as having “particular physical and operational features important for
water-dependent industrial uses—such as commercial fishing, shipping, and other vessel-related
marine commercial activities—and/or for manufacturing, processing, and production activities
that require marine transportation or need large volumes of water for withdrawal or discharge.
While water-dependent industrial uses vary in scale and intensity, they all generally share a need
for infrastructure with three essential components: (1) a waterway and associated waterfront that
has been developed for some form of commercial navigation or other direct utilization of the
water; (2) backland space that is conducive in both physical configuration and use character to
the siting of industrial facilities and operations; and (3) land-based transportation and public
utility services appropriate for general industrial purposes.”
Please refer to Response to Comment C4 and Response to Comment E1 regarding spills or
releases and EPA’s authority through the NPDES program with regard to incidental releases
and/or emergency situations. The NPDES permit regulates the types of effluent defined in the
permits for each facility, which have the potential to come into contact with spills or releases.
Ultimately, if the spill occurs within the facility and reaches the Chelsea River through the
permitted outfalls, the spill is regulated by the permits. The final permits include specific Best
Management Practices and prohibited discharges impacting the permissibility of discharges of
incidental spills. The Standard Conditions further describe requirements for certain bypass or
upset conditions.

40

With regard to longer term goals, as the United States Supreme Court has explained, “[t]he
Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly known as the Clean Water Act, is a
comprehensive water quality statute designed to ‘restore and maintain the chemical, physical,
and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.’ The Act also seeks to attain ‘water quality which
provides for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife.’” 39 Two additional
goals were established: zero discharge of pollutants by 1985 and, as an interim goal and where
possible, water quality that is both “fishable” and “swimmable” by mid-1983.40 While those
dates have passed, the goals remain, and efforts to attain them continue. As a result, the Clean
Water Act is generally considered a technology-forcing statute because it requires dischargers to
achieve higher and higher levels of pollution abatement.41 In these permits, technology-forcing
effluent limitations include the increasingly stringent limits on polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene, and the volatile organic compound, benzene. To
comply with many of the effluent limits, the facilities may need to utilize treatment technologies
and BMPs to reduce the level of pollutants to very low levels (i.e., below the minimum level for
analysis). Further, treatment technology and Best Management Practices that will reduce these
compounds to the low levels required is expected to further reduce concentrations of all other
pollutants of concern over the permit term. EPA will evaluate the levels of pollution in the
discharges, potential impacts to water quality of the discharges, and potential technologies
available to reduce pollutant levels during subsequent permit renewals.
Comments submitted by Madeleine Scammell, Chelsea Board of Health:
Comment G1:
Thank you. My name is Madeline Scammell. I'm a resident of Chelsea. I serve on the Board of
Health. I'm an environmental health scientist myself. I study cumulative risk analysis. I'm one of
EPA's grantees under the STAR program in partnership with the Chelsea Collaborative. But, I
don't have to do any really fancy analyses to recognize cumulative exposures as in this situation.
And so, I guess, I have a comment and a question, which I understand you can't answer now.
But, I would like to be on the record.
I feel like the Environmental Justice analysis that was done was nice for characterizing our city
as it is and the health of Chelsea Creek, or Chelsea River as it's called. But, the conclusion just
surprises me. EPA acknowledges that the Chelsea River and surrounding communities are
impacted by many environmental burdens. Yes. That is the case. And yet, has determined that
the facility's discharges will not result in disproportionately high environmental effects.
The benzene concentrations that are allowed, 51 micrograms per liter, are typical of NPDES
permits and are not lower than this typical amount for any of the seven permits that are being
considered today. And seven permits equals a lot more than 51. I don't know what the flow rate
is in terms of what will actually be discharged to result in the water quality concentration of
benzene. But, I do know that toxic effects on aquatic species have been found at 700 micrograms
PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Washington Dept. of Ecology, 511 U.S. 700, 704 (1994) (quoting 33 U.S.C.
§ 1251(a)) (internal citations omitted).

41

per liter. So, that's not a whole lot more than 51 without doing any calculations. And while 51
micrograms per liter is a low amount, it's orders of magnitude higher than the drinking water
standard. And we don't drink that water, of course. But, we do muck around in it sometimes, like
on April 26th when we're going to clean the Chelsea Creek.
And as an Environmental Justice community, it's not so much about the health effects as it is
quality of life. And I feel like EPA Region 1 has a real opportunity to make a point that 51 may
be typical. But, here, we can reduce it and we can make a difference in terms of reducing
cumulative effects on our environment and our ability to enjoy the environment. So, with that, I
will just thank you again for being here.
Response to Comment G1:
The effluent limitations for benzene included the permits range from “non-detect” (compliance
level established at 2 µg/L) to 51 µg/L. The effluent limitations that are technology-based, that
is, based on the amount of benzene permitted in an effluent when a specific type of treatment is
applied, are 5 µg/L at four internal outfalls and 40 µg/L at one primary outfall. Discharges
through outfalls with TBELs are first treated by carbon adsorption except at one internal outfall
previously treated by carbon adsorption where the limit was retained to meet anti-antibacksliding requirements. The effluent limitations that are water quality-based are applied at the
end-of-pipe (i.e., no allowable dilution) at 51 µg/L at five direct discharges to Chelsea River and
2 µg/L at one direct discharge to Sales Creek.
When including national recommended water quality criteria in NPDES permits, EPA has
inherently included an assessment of risk. As noted in Response to Comment C1, any human
health criterion for a toxicant is based on at least three interrelated considerations: 1) cancer
potency or systemic toxicity; 2) exposure; and 3) risk characterization. National Recommended
Water Quality Criteria are derived using risk assessment methodology. Therefore, a human
health criterion is the highest concentration of a pollutant in water that is not expected to pose a
significant risk to human health based on the toxicity, exposure, and acceptable risk levels as set
forth by EPA. The commenter is correct that the human health organism-only criterion is less
stringent than the drinking water standard for benzene. However, EPA cannot apply the drinking
water standard to effluent limitations in these permits unless such a standard is applicable. Since
the Chelsea River is not a drinking water supply, a criterion for consumption of water is not
applicable. Based on the designated uses defined in Massachusetts’ WQSs and the promulgated
water quality criteria, the human health organism-only criterion of 51 µg/L is appropriate.
Furthermore, the benzene limitations in the permits are concentration-based, rather than massbased. As a result, a summation of the limits cannot be strictly compared to the criterion in
determining if a limit will meet WQSs. If all facilities simultaneously and continuously
discharge, and all discharge concentrations are 51 µg/L, and the concentration in the Chelsea
River is 51 µg/L, then the resulting instream concentration with no dilution is 51 µg/L. This is
more than an order of magnitude less than the 700 µg/L level at which acute effects on aquatic
life have been documented. Additionally, if 700 µg/L were an acute criterion, it would not be
comparable to an instantaneous maximum concentration, but rather, averaged over a specific
interval, which is four hours for many acute criteria.
42

As discussed in the permits’ fact sheets, each facility was subject to effluent limitations for
benzene under their current permits. In developing water quality based limits for the reissued
permits, EPA considered new information regarding the impairments to Chelsea River. While it
is listed as impaired for petroleum hydrocarbons (through a qualitative assessment of a narrative
description rather than measurements above a numeric criterion), it is not specifically listed as
impaired for benzene. The highest concentration of benzene recorded in the Chelsea River within
the previous three years is 2.4 µg/L. Over the previous three years, benzene was not detected at
Global Petroleum Outfall 003, Global REVCO Outfall 001, Gulf Oil Outfall 003, and Sunoco
Logistics Outfall 001. Benzene was detected in one of 12 samples at Chelsea Sandwich Outfall
001 (5.26 µg/L) and one of 6 samples at Irving Oil Outfall 001 (9.23 µg/L). Benzene was
detected in two of 12 samples at Global South Outfall 001 (1.5 µg/L and 29.5 µg/L) and in 17 of
35 samples (ranging from 1.0 µg/L to 32.2 µg/L) at Global Petroleum Outfall 002. A three year
period of review is noted because it is representative of current and future discharge
concentrations and volume and aligns with recommendations in EPA’s Technical Support
Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control for evaluating attainment of an acute or
chronic criterion. As discussed in the permits’ fact sheets, EPA completed a combined
qualitative reasonable potential analysis in developing limits for benzene because of data quality
issues (e.g., limited quantity of data, high proportion of non-detect data, high degree of
uncertainty/variability in the available data). EPA also allowed no assimilative capacity in the
receiving water.
Given the impairments to the Chelsea River for “petroleum hydrocarbons” and the characteristics
which make benzene well-suited for use as an indicator parameter for the pollutant “petroleum
hydrocarbons”, EPA maintained numeric limits for benzene in the draft permits. Benzene is one
of three indicator parameters used in combination to ensure that the discharges from the facilities
do not cause or contribute to an excursion above WQSs for petroleum/petroleum hydrocarbons.
Further, as the pervious permits contained numeric limitations for benzene, and no exception to
anti-backsliding has been satisfied, EPA maintained numeric limits for benzene to meet
requirements for anti-backsliding. EPA maintains that these limits are reasonable and sufficiently
stringent to ensure compliance with applicable water quality standards as required by Clean
Water Act Section 401(a)(2) and 40 C.F.R. §122.4(d). As EPA applied the water quality
criterion for benzene as an indicator parameter for “petroleum hydrocarbons” at the end-of-pipe
for each outfall, EPA believes this includes an adequate margin of safety to account for
cumulative effects of benzene. With respect to EPA’s evaluation of cumulative effects for all
pollutants of concern for these permits, including benzene, also see Response to Comment C1.

Comments submitted by Dave Prusky, Chelsea resident:
Comment H1:
I'm a lifelong resident of Chelsea. And that's about 76 years now. So, I know where a lot of the
bodies are buried, and many of them were dumped close by my house in recent years.
43

Here's my thought for the day. Is there any reason why these permits cannot include a
requirement for these profitable companies to make their numbers available to the public? Early
this morning, I tried to look this up. It's nowhere on the internet. In other words, all of these
measurements of the outfalls, and measurements of the flow, there's nowhere that the public can
access it. So, we don't know if the river is getting worse, better or just staying the same.
I would like to see each of these companies set up a web page, required in the permit, a web page
that includes every measurement for all of these things, put it into a spreadsheet on that web page
so that the public has a continuous view of what's going into the river. I think that would be
fairly simple to do. Spreadsheets have been around since computers became available to the
general public. Web pages are easy to do too, unless you happen to be the health authority at the
federal level apparently.
That's what I would like to see. I want to know, is the river getting better, or is it getting worse. I
have the feeling, based upon what was said today, that since pollutants are still allowed to go into
the river that it is getting worse. And I don't believe that's what the Clean Water Act had in mind.
Response to Comment H1:
EPA understands that accessing environmental data can at times be cumbersome. Please see
Response to Comment C2 for some of the key informational resources that provide the requested
information. EPA continues to work to improve the systems through which the public can access
such information. In these permits, EPA has enhanced transparency and public accountability
regarding compliance and enforcement performance by requiring electronic reporting through
NetDMR42. NetDMR is expected to increase the availability of compliance data to the public on
a timely basis. Given the widespread interest in access to compliance information for these
facilities, EPA has shortened the timeframe for how long a facility has to begin using NetDMR
from twelve (12) months to six (6) months from the effective date of the permit. Several of the
permitted facilities already use NetDMR.
However, the system into which compliance data are entered is not a spreadsheet-based program,
as the commenter requests. Therefore, as reflected in the final permits, EPA is requiring the
Permittees to post discharge monitoring data (including any reports) and the facility’s
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (including annual certifications, updates and BMP
implementation documentation) to their respective company’s publicly-accessible internet
webpage, to the extent practicable. If a permittee determines this requirement is impracticable,
EPA anticipates requesting copies of SWPPPs be submitted to EPA for posting via its website.
This information, when submitted to the Agencies and/or the municipalities in which the
facilities are located, already required by the draft permits, becomes available to public through
the administrative record. Also see Response to Comment B6.
EPA further encourages the permittees to expend effort to improve their relationships with the
surrounding communities. EPA recommends permittees consider voluntary outreach efforts to
the communities in which they are located. Such efforts may follow, for example, the public

notification requirement included in the nine minimum controls included in EPA’s National
Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy (see 59 FR 18688 and Section 402(q) of the Federal
Clean Water Act), the Public involvement activities required under the Massachusetts
Contingency Plan (see 310 C.M.R. 40.1400), and recommendations described in Appendix A of
EPA’s Watershed-Based National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permitting
Technical Guidance.43 Such efforts are not mandated in the permits. However, EPA regards
outreach efforts as a voluntary incentive factor to consider on a case-by-case basis under Interim
Guidance for Performance-Based Reduction of NPDES Permit Monitoring Frequencies in the
event monitoring frequency reductions are requested.44
EPA continues to look for effective ways to inform communities and interested persons about the
compliance status of these facilities and the status of the Chelsea River. Currently, the Chelsea
River remains impaired for the designated uses assigned by Massachusetts to a Class SB
waterbody. Also see Response to Comment C2.
Comments submitted by Staci Rubin, Senior Attorney, Environmental Justice Legal
Services Director, Alternatives for Community & Environment, Inc.
Comment I1:
Good evening. My name is Staci Rubin. I am the senior attorney and director of the
Environmental Justice Legal Services Program at ACE, Alternatives for Community and
Environment. ACE is providing legal services to residents in Revere, Chelsea and East Boston
regarding the Draft NPDES Permits for the seven facilities that are the subject of tonight's public
hearing. My comments tonight are on behalf of ACE. And we, along with the residents of
Chelsea, East Boston and Revere will submit detailed written comments by May 12th.
Thank you to both EPA and DEP for holding tonight's hearing at a convenient location and
providing translated documents in advance, as well as the interpretation for tonight's public
hearing. I appreciate that EPA took the time to meet with ACE and members of the Chelsea
Creek Action Group on three occasions in 2013, and held a community meeting last June about
the NPDES process.
There is an anti-backsliding requirement for NPDES permits, which means that the requirements
of a subsequent or newly issued permit may not be less stringent than previous permits. As has
been said, the Chelsea Creek water quality continues to disappoint. The Commonwealth has
classified the Chelsea Creek as a Class SB water body, meaning that its water quality should be
able to support wading, swimming, fishing, boating and a health fish and aquatic life community.
Yet, the water has not achieved this standard. No matter how far away this standard appears, the
water quality should improve notwithstanding sanitary sewer overflows, combined sewer
overflows and marine vessel pollution.
My remaining comments concern all seven permits. First, my comments concerning the permits
from a technical perspective. The Chelsea River is listed as a Category 5 waters, which requires a
43
44

EPA 833-B-07-004
EPA 833-B-96-001

45

total maximum daily load on the final Massachusetts year 2012 Integrated List of Waters under
the Clean Water Act. This is both Sections 303(d) and 305(b). The pollutants and conditions
requiring a total maximum daily load are ammonia, fecal coliform, dissolved oxygen,
polychlorinated biphenyls in fish, petroleum hydrocarbons and others. The designated uses for
the Chelsea River are impaired. Sources of those impairments include the petroleum facilities at
issue tonight. EPA and DEP state that the Draft Permit sufficient limit petroleum hydrocarbons
and total suspended solids to ensure that discharges do not cause or contribute to the aquatic life
impairment. EPA and DEP cannot make this statement because there is no total maximum daily
load limits that have been set for the Chelsea River. These permits, all seven, should not be
issued prior to establishment of the total maximum daily load limits. The state of Rhode Island
recently established these limits for a portion of the Blackstone River. And that's a river that has
endured heavy industrial use similar to the Chelsea Creek. The Commonwealth and EPA could
incorporate this effort as a model. Further, the Mystic River Watershed Association has recorded
data for the Chelsea Creek which could help establish a baseline for these numbers.
Should EPA and DEP disagree and decide to issue these final permits without first approving
total maximum daily loads, then I respectfully request additional conditions for these permits.
The pollutant scans for each facility outfall should be required quarterly, not annually. Including
for ethanol, for facilities that store or manage ethanol. And the permittees should be required to
conduct the pollutant scan, effluent testing at regular quarterly intervals. The permittees should
be required to conduct the whole effluent toxicity testing quarterly, not annually. And the
permittee should be required to report immediately when they exceed the total flow rate and the
maximum daily flow rate. Furthermore, both EPA and DEP should conduct more frequent and
unannounced inspections of all seven facilities, and issue fines when the facilities are out of
compliance. All seven of the terminals have been out of compliance at least one quarter during
the past five years. And to my knowledge, EPA or DEP did not take any enforcement action. The
EPA should also establish a website specifically dedicated to the Chelsea Creek that includes
updated information about current and past water quality tests and violation information.
In addition to the reasons I just discussed, the Draft Permits are inadequate because of their
failure to consider climate change impacts. Section 316(a) of the Clean Water Act requires EPA
to consider the change to the ambient water temperature in the Chelsea Creek because of an
effluent discharge. Several of these facilities have boiler blow down from steam boilers, which
would release more and more hot water into the creek. And that warming of the water needs to
be considered in the climate change context. As water temperatures increase, water pollution
problems will increase. As temperature increases, dissolved oxygen levels will be creating more
complex environmental conditions which don't seem to be taken into consideration with these
Draft Permits. Further, these permits are jointly issued by EPA and DEP as was said. And under
General Laws of Massachusetts, Chapter 30, Section 61, in paragraph 2, DEP needs to make
findings about reasonably foreseeable climate change impacts, which have not been done in the
Draft Permits.
My next comments concern the Environmental Justice Assessment. While this particular
Environmental Justice analysis is the most robust that I have seen out of Region 1, I think, more
analyses are required. EPA recently developed a tool, CFERST, the Community Focused
Exposure and Risk Screening Tool. That should be consulted to identify additional health
46

information, such as cancer rates, particularly for cancers that are known to be associated with
benzene exposure. There should be some analysis of whether health indicators in the study area
and the larger host cities demonstrate health inequities, whether there are -- the health of one
racial or ethnic group is different than other racial or ethnic groups, and how those compare to
the statewide average. And there should also be an analysis of water exposure and how contact
with the contaminated water could affect human health.
Further, EPA concludes in its assessment that, because the effluent limits in the Draft Permits
will ensure that the facilities do not contribute to water violations, this permitting action with
therefore not disproportionately affect human health or the environment. This seems to be quite
conclusory and it doesn't discuss how the effluent limits will improve water quality or remedy
the past injustice of the environmental contamination. EPA should consider whether to require
that signs be placed at the various access points to the creek. There are a few. But, whether those
should be placed, and discuss the water impairments to the creek. Those signs should be
available in multiple languages.
In conclusion, the communities that abut the facilities on the Chelsea Creek face not only an
Environmental Justice burden, but a pollution burden of historical proportions. These permits
must acknowledge this reality and incorporate the suggested changes so that conditions in the
Chelsea Creek improve and contribute to environmental justice in Chelsea, East Boston and
Revere.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
Response to Comment I1:
See Response to Comment C1 through Response to Comment C6, as the comments are
substantially identical. This comment also appears in Part III., below. Regarding comments
specific to EPA’s EJA, please see Part III.
Comments submitted by Roseann Bongiovanni, Associate Executive Director, Chelsea
Collaborative:
Comment J1:
Good evening. My name is Roseann Bongiovanni. I'm a Chelsea resident and I'm also the
Assistant Director of the Chelsea Collaborative, which represents the Chelsea side of the Chelsea
Creek Action Group. Thank you to the EPA and the DEP for being here this evening in Chelsea,
and for making this presentation and for providing interpretation services for our community.
I also would like to thank the EPA for conducting an Environmental Justice analysis in
correlation to these NPDES permits. In going through the EJ analysis, I had a comment that
stood out to me. I was looking at the compliance and inspection history. Global Petroleum
terminal had four violations. And yet, there are only two federal Clean Water Act inspections.
Global REVCO terminal had three violations. And yet, there are only two Clean Water Act
inspections from the federal government. Irving had five violations. And there are only three
47

federal inspections. Similarly, Chelsea Sandwich had two violations and only two inspections.
And four violations for the Gulf Oil terminal and only one inspection. And all of these
inspections happened over a five year time frame. So, in the course of five years, each of these
facilities, the maximum time that they got inspected was four. So, less than once per year. And
that was for Sunoco that actually had no violations. It's startling to me how few inspections from
the EPA there are on these facilities. There are seven facilities. As you've heard from so many
members of this body and others, these communities surrounding the facilities are Environmental
Justice communities. And we need more regular inspections of these facilities. We're relying on
the industries to tell us when they're in violation of their own permits. So, we're essentially
trusting the word of the companies, and yet, not doing any enforcement, taking any enforcement
actions, or following up with any inspections. I implore you, in these NPDES permits, to require
more frequent inspections by the EPA, at a very minimum of twice per year of each of these
terminal facilities. And I would encourage you to do those inspections on an unannounced visit
rather than letting them know well in advance so that they can prepare adequately.
Further, I've learned from other communities in the nearby area that, when there have been
violations of federal or state permits, the community has advocated that those companies in
violation of their permits pay for consultants so that community groups, like the Chelsea Creek
Action Group, could be better informed of what those violations mean and how those results are
interpreted to the community. So, I would implore you to include those on these NPDES permits.
That any time one of these industries is in violation of their permit that they either, one, pay
towards a community enhancement or improvement project. Or two, that they provide for a
consultant to translate these results to the community at large.
Similar to City Council President Frank, I want to encourage you to look at these permits, and as
Madeline said as well, in a cumulative effect. You know, as we've heard, we're looking at each
one of these permits in a silo, as if only -- as if there was only one terminal along the creek.
There are seven terminals, seven terminals discharging pollutants all the time into the Chelsea
Creek. And the only way that we can improve the Chelsea Creek is to have these permits be
more and more stringent. The last time we issued these permits was in 2005. While there have
been some changes and improvements made on these permits that you have shown as the Draft,
we still feel like they're not stringent enough. They need to be far more stringent. We've gone
almost 10 years. A lot has happened in 10 years. And these permits should reflect that. In 10
years’ time, we want to be here saying that the Chelsea Creek is far cleaner than it was in 2014.
And with the permits the way they are right now, we don't see that happening. The Chelsea
Creek Action Group with the Mystic River Watershed Association and other organizations have
been working very, very hard to improve the water quality of the Chelsea Creek, to reduce
stormwater runoff, to reduce pollutants, to work with companies to be more accountable. And
the only way we can deal with this holistically is if the EPA and DEP were to come down harder
on these industries that are lining our waterfront.
Again, I want to thank you for coming here this evening. And I hope that, as you go back and
review this data that, again, you think about Environmental Justice and this being an
Environmental Justice -- all of these communities that are on the creek, being Environmental
Justice communities, and that you take this opportunity as a significant step forward to say that

48

Environmental Justice is important and that we want to do the right thing to make these permits
even more stringent.
Thank you.
Response to Comment J1:
With regard to compliance and inspection, refer to Response to Comment B8, Response to
Comment C2, and Response to Comment E1. Monitoring requirements under the NPDES
permitting program are designed to be “self-implementing” and “self-reporting”. The permits
require that the permittee’s duly authorized representative certify the truth, accuracy, and
completeness of all applications, reports and other information submitted to EPA. The Clean
Water Act subjects permittees and individuals to criminal liability for falsifying these
submissions. In addition, on-site inspections or EPA requests for documents provide
opportunities for EPA inspectors to review records that are used to prepare submissions and
these methods provide another mechanism for independently verifying submission accuracy. The
“self-implementing” aspect of the program also means that the permittee is accountable for all
aspects of the work to ensure compliance, including the selecting of contractors, paying for the
work that is performed, and ensuring that such work is conducted and properly reported to the
appropriate permitting authority. Under Part II. of the permits, the facilities are required to
notify EPA and MassDEP within 24 hours from the time the permittee becomes aware of
noncompliance circumstances that may endanger health or the environment.
To ensure compliance, the facilities are subject to inspection under multiple state and federal
programs. Inspections of facilities with NPDES permits are performed by EPA Region 1’s Office
of Environmental Stewardship. EPA’s Office of Site Remediation and Restoration also regularly
inspects the bulk fuel storage facilities for their compliance with the Oil Pollution Act.
Additionally, these facilities are inspected by MassDEP. Whether the inspection is announced or
unannounced is determined by the type of inspection and the regulatory program under which the
inspection is occurring. EPA’s inspection frequency depends on such factors as the regulatory
requirements of the program, the compliance history of the facility, the EPA resources available
to perform inspections and the extent of competing environmental priorities. Monitoring results
are reviewed with the goal of prioritizing inspections as well as for resolving any violations
identified in a timely manner. EPA attempts to take all of the above factors into account when
developing an appropriate inspection frequency. EPA enforcement and assistance staff may also
use environmental justice as a factor in choosing sectors and facilities to address, and developing
the appropriate inspection frequency.45
With regard to the requests for a technical expert to provide public notification to the
communities and funding for enhancement or improvement projects, see Response to Comment
C5.

In reference to the comments submitted by the individuals referenced pertaining to cumulative
effect, refer to Response to Comment F1 and Response to Comment G1. Also see Response to
Comment C1. EPA has taken into account cumulative impacts in the development of these
permits under the Clean Water Act, to the extent required by law, and to the extent necessary to
ensure discharges comply with Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality Standards.
In accordance with 40 C.F.R. §122.44(l), the reissued permits contain no effluent limitations less
stringent than the previous permits. On the contrary, the final permits contain multiple new
effluent limitations and monitoring requirements that are more stringent than the previous
permits. While a ten year period is noted for assessing the progress achieved through the permits,
EPA notes that the permit term for these reissued NPDES permits is five years (see 40 C.F.R.
§124.6(a)), at which point, in accordance with 40 C.F.R. §122.6(a), when EPA is the permitting
authority, “the conditions of an expired permit continue in force under 5 U.S.C. §558(c) until the
effective date of the new permit.” In addition, these permits do not trigger an anti-degradation
review under 314 C.M.R. 4.04 in accordance with 40 C.F.R. §131.12, as the authorized
discharges are not new sources defined under 40 C.F.R. 122.29, nor has any increased discharge
been authorized.
While the control of discharges from these point sources is significant to the water quality of
Chelsea River, EPA does not concur that improvements to the water quality of Chelsea River are
exclusively dependent upon the pollutant characteristics of effluent from these facilities alone.
Additional point source and non-point source contributions have been documented as sources of
the pollutants causing or contributing to impairments to the designated uses of the waterbody in
the Mystic River Watershed and Coastal Drainage Area 2004-2008 Water Quality Assessment
Report.46 EPA considered these additional sources in its approach to WQBEL development, as
described in detail in the permits’ fact sheets and in Response to Comment C1, Response to
Comment G1, and Response to Comment F1.
EPA appreciates Chelsea Creek Action Group’s and Mystic River Watershed Association’s
efforts in the Chelsea River watershed and encourages the organizations and the communities to
continue to engage in the NPDES process. EPA has reconsidered multiple aspects of the permits
in view of the comments received during the public notice, including the public hearing. Multiple
changes have been incorporated which provide further protection to the Chelsea River and
surrounding communities. For example, see Response to Comment B2, Response to Comment
B3, Response to Comment B6, and Response to Comment C1.

50

Thank you very much. My name is John Vitagliano. I live in Winthrop. I wanted to very briefly
endorse exactly what Staci Rubin and Roseann Bongiovanni have stated for the record with
respect to the permits.
I'd like to add one additional thought, if I might. As I've been reviewing what this proceeding is
all about, it seems to me, what we're doing is asking for permission to endorse the seven oil
terminals, to authorize them to discharge a certain amount of toxic pollutants into the Chelsea
Creek up to a certain level, whatever level that might be. And to actually improve upon that to a
substantial degree, I am suggesting that the entire system of oil water separation ought to be
replaced by a zero discharge concept where the seven oil companies ought to be required by EPA
and DEP to fully contain all of their contaminated liquid from their facilities, then put on tankers,
their own tankers, and shipped to a facility where that contaminated liquid can then be processed
accordingly, so that there would be no discharge whatsoever in the future by any of the seven oil
terminals. And that ought to be an urgent matter and enforced onto the seven oil terminals by
EPA and DEP.
Thank you.
Response to Comment K1:
With respect to comments submitted by the individuals mentioned, please see Response to
Comment C1 through Response to Comment C5, Response to Comment I1, and Response to
Comment J1.
EPA has the authority in accordance with various statutory and regulatory requirements
established pursuant to the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §1251 et seq., the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program (see Section 402 and the implementing
regulations generally found at 40 C.F.R. Parts 122, 124, 125, and 136) and applicable
Massachusetts regulations (generally including 314 C.M.R. 3.00 and 314 C.M.R. 4.00) to include
specific effluent limitations and other requirements such as monitoring and reporting in NPDES
permits. However, EPA typically cannot dictate what measures the permittee must take to meet
such permit conditions. When developing effluent limits for a NPDES permit, a permit writer
must consider both limits based on the technology available to treat the pollutants (TBELs), and
limits that are protective of the designated uses of the receiving water (WQBELs).
As explained in the permits’ fact sheets, technology-based treatment requirements represent the
minimum level of control that must be imposed under Sections 301(b) and 402 of the Clean
Water Act (see 40 C.F.R. §125 Subpart A) to meet best practicable control technology currently
available (“BPT”) for conventional pollutants and some metals, best conventional control
technology (“BCT”) for conventional pollutants, and best available technology economically
achievable (“BAT”) for toxic and non-conventional pollutants. When technology-based National
Effluent Limitation Guidelines (“ELGs”) have not been promulgated, as is the case for these
permits, EPA is authorized under Section 402(a)(1)(B) of the Clean Water Act to establish
TBELs on a case-by-case basis using Best Professional Judgment (“BPJ”).

51

To impose a zero discharge limitation that is technology-based, the BCT, BPT and/or BAT
applied would be capable of achieving such levels of the pollutants present in the effluent. EPA
determined that a zero discharge limitation, particularly for volatile organic compounds and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, is not achievable using currently available pollution control
technology. EPA made this determination based on a review of TBELs established using BPJ in
EPA Region 1’s RGP and/or TBELs promulgated under industrial categories for similar
discharges with similar forms of treatment: 1) phase separation; 2) sedimentation; 3) filtration;
4) air stripping; and/or 5) carbon adsorption.
EPA established numeric and narrative effluent limitations achievable by applying one or more
of these technologies, which are in use at all seven facilities. The rationale supporting the TBELs
established using BPJ is included in the permits’ fact sheets. While the permittees could chose to
comply with the permit limits by shipping stormwater and/or wastewater off-site for treatment,
EPA is not requiring that they do so. Off-site transfer and treatment of largely uncontaminated
stormwater would be impractical, and would incur unreasonable costs relative to the
environmental benefits. The treatment technologies appropriate to the types of effluent
discharged from the facilities are widely available, effective and reasonably cost effective.
Under Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Clean Water Act and EPA regulations, NPDES permits must
contain effluent limits more stringent than TBELs where more stringent limits are necessary to
maintain or achieve state or federal water quality standards. EPA would require a zero discharge
limitation as a water quality-based limitation in an NPDES permit if it determined such a
restriction is necessary to meet Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality Standards (WQSs) (see
314 C.M.R. 4.00). Massachusetts’ WQSs for the classification assigned to the Chelsea River,
Class SB/CSO, do not contain numeric or narrative criteria requiring a zero discharge limitation.
However, based on the characteristics of certain types of process waters generated at these
facilities, several discharges have been prohibited in the permits, essentially equal to a zero
discharge. For example, discharges of tank bottom and bilge water, process waters which are
known to contain high concentrations of multiple pollutants of concern, are not allowed. Also see
Response to Comment G1.
EPA notes that because Massachusetts’ classification of Sales Creek (Class SA/ORW) (see 314
C.M.R. 4.06) differs from that of Chelsea River (Class SB/CSO), no discharge of petroleumrelated constituents has been authorized for the outfall discharging to that waterbody (Outfall
005 in Permit No. MA0003298, Global REVCO, LLC). EPA made the determination that to
meet Massachusetts Surface WQSs, 314 C.M.R. 4.05(4)(a)(7) which states, “[t]hese waters shall
be free from oil and grease and petrochemicals” the discharge could contain no measurable oil
and grease and petrochemicals. Thus a numeric limitation equivalent to “no measurable”
quantity for the oil and grease, VOC and PAH parameters was included in the permit. EPA
equates these limitations to no measurable discharge, as any concentration is quantified to the
extent possible, and to a degree approaching zero.
Although the commenter’s recommendations regarding treatment for effluent have overall merit
for these facilities, it is ultimately up to the permittee to decide on specific measures in this
regard. However, EPA has determined a zero discharge limitation is not necessary to meet the
requirements of the Clean Water Act and to ensure compliance with Massachusetts’ WQSs.

Part II. Comments submitted on individual draft permits as noted:
Comments submitted which pertain to Chelsea Sandwich Terminal (#MA0003280):
Comments submitted by Michael A. Leon, Nutter, McClennen & Fish, LLP, on behalf of
Chelsea Sandwich, LLC:
Comment L1:
Chelsea Sandwich appreciates the enormous effort that EPA devoted to preparing the draft
permit, and finds that much of the content is reasonable and appropriate. Chelsea Sandwich
believes, however, that certain provisions are inapt particularly in considering presently available
information regarding the terminal.
In the balance of this letter, Chelsea Sandwich identifies the modifications it believes
appropriate, and explains the bases for each.
Response to Comment L1:
EPA notes the comment.
Comment L2:
Comment 1 – The proposed discharge limits and sample parameters must be related to the
discharge reasonably expected from a facility.
EPA must have a rational basis for determining a facility’s discharge limits and sampling
parameters. EPA improperly relies upon Section 308 of the Clean Water Act to provide authority
to require reporting of information necessary to establish appropriate discharge limits. EPA,
through reporting requirements, seeks to determine if discharge limitations are necessary in the
future. However, the basis for establishing reporting requirements should be to limit and treat the
constituents known to exist in the groundwater, soil and other surficial areas at a facility or the
discharge from that facility that may impact the receiving waterbody. The sampling parameters
and frequency should not encompass potential substances that have no connection to the
discharge, have not been detected at a facility, are not in use at or in processes at a facility, or
which are not under the control of a permitted operator. The following changes should be made
to the final permits.
A. Monitoring for chromium, iron, cyanide, phenol, phthalates, ammonia and fecal
coliform should be deleted.
 Chromium, cyanide and phenols are generally emitted by coating or plating
processes. Chelsea Sandwich is unaware of any historic process at the terminal
that used these constituents, or of any sample data that suggests these constituents
are present in the stormwater discharge from the terminal. As these substances are

not actually present at the terminal and are not used or stored at the terminal, there
is no basis to require testing for them.
Global is unaware of any past process activities that released iron at the terminal.
As noted by EPA in the facts sheets, iron occurs naturally in the soils in the area.
As there is no evidence that iron impacts the stormwater discharge above
expected background levels, there is no basis to require testing for iron.
Phthalates are generally associated with plastic manufacturing. Chelsea Sandwich
is unaware of any historic process at the terminal that used phthalates, or of any
sample data that suggests phthalates are or have been present in the soil,
groundwater or stormwater discharge from the terminal.
Fecal coliform testing should not be required as there is no process or sanitary
discharge to the outfall at the terminal. While the Chelsea River is impaired for its
designated uses, and fecal coliform is a pollutant requiring a TMDL, there is no
evidence to suggest that the terminal is or has been a source.
Should EPA elect to not adopt the above approach, Chelsea Sandwich proposes in
the alternative that the sampling for these constituents be conducted in the first
year, but for each constituent that is not detected above background levels,
nothing thereafter.

B. If, following the first required WET Test, it is shown that the discharge from the
terminal has the same or greater survivability of the target species than that of the
Receiving Water (Chelsea Creek), the proposed annual testing should be changed to
require testing only every three years.
C. The frequency of any monthly sample parameter reported by the analyzing laboratory
as not detected in a given discharge over a twelve (12) month sampling period should
be automatically amended to require only quarterly sampling.
Response to Comment L2:
With regard to item A., Sections 101, 301(b), 304, 308, 401, and 402 of the Clean Water Act
provide the basis for the effluent limitations and other conditions in the permits. EPA evaluates
discharges with respect to these sections of the Clean Water Act and the relevant NPDES
regulations to determine which conditions to include in the draft permit. This includes
consideration of pollutants or parameters not only known to be present in a discharge, but also
those pollutants or parameters that may reasonably be present depending upon, among other
things, the type of facility, pollutant sources, and the type(s) of effluent discharged. CWA
§308(a), 33 U.S.C. §1318(a), authorizes EPA to require the owner or operator of any point
source to provide information as may reasonably be required to:
... carry out the objectives of ... [the Clean Water Act], including
but not limited to: (1) developing or assisting in the development
of any effluent limitation, or other limitation, prohibition ... or
standard of performance under [the Clean Water Act] ...; (2)
determining whether any person is in violation of any such effluent
limitation, or other limitation, prohibition or effluent standard, ...
or standard of performance; (3)any requirement established under
54

this section; or (4) carrying out section ... 1342 ... of [the Clean
Water Act] ...
EPA evaluated the discharge to determine compliance with Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Clean
Water Act by establishing limitations and monitoring requirements necessary to meet water
quality standards. The regulations at 40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)(1) implement section 301(b)(1)(C) of
the Clean Water Act. These regulations require that NPDES permits include limits for all
pollutants or parameters which “are or may be discharged at a level which will cause, have the
reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above any State water quality
standard, including State narrative criteria for water quality.” When information is insufficient to
make this determination, as EPA’s Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics
Control recommends, the collection of this information is required, either through an information
request during permit development, if time allows, or incorporated into permit conditions.47
Therefore, EPA determined which pollutants are of concern for the facilities. First, EPA
reviewed the existing permits to determine if current limitations were adequate and whether
monitoring conducted during the permit term indicated additional limitations were required. EPA
included limits or conditions for both conventional pollutants (e.g., total suspended solids and oil
& grease) and non-conventional and/or toxic petroleum-related compounds, including the
volatile organic compounds (e.g., benzene), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g.,
benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene), oxygenates (e.g., methyl-tert-butyl ether and ethanol) and
residuals (e.g., cyanide) in the permits, based on site-specific product storage, processes, reported
releases, monitoring results, and historic uses.
Second, EPA reviewed each permittee’s permit renewal application, including analytical data.
EPA noted concentrations of certain metals and ammonia at levels that exceed or could
potentially exceed applicable criteria. In this review, EPA identified ammonia, iron, lead and
cadmium as pollutants of concern. Ammonia, for which the Chelsea River is impaired, was
reported at a concentration of 2.31 mg/L, whereas the recommended chronic criterion value is
2.4 mg/L. Further, while iron compounds can be naturally occurring in groundwater, excessive
amounts may cause or contribute to violations of water quality standards for color, turbidity,
solids, and odor, as well as fouling of the discharge treatment systems. Iron is also present in de
minimis quantities in certain petroleum products. The applicable criterion for iron, as
promulgated under the National Recommended Water Quality Criteria, is an organoleptic
criterion set at 300 µg/L. The facility reported an iron concentration of 804 µg/L at Outfall 001
and 403 µg/L at Outfall 002. Other metals detected in the facility’s effluent as reported in the
permit renewal application include barium, cadmium, lead, and selenium. All are present in
petroleum products stored at the facility.48 Therefore, EPA included additional monitoring
requirements for the above listed pollutants, except barium and selenium. Barium does not have
an applicable water quality criterion and is not a priority pollutant. Selenium was detected at very
low concentrations well below applicable aquatic life criteria. Since lead and cadmium
monitoring is already required for whole effluent toxicity testing, testing for these constituents
were not added as a separate requirement.

Third, EPA evaluated pollutants with the potential to enter the stormwater conveyance system
through infiltration of contaminated groundwater, through stormwater contact with contaminated
soil and/or sediment, or via the discharge of hydrostatic test water or boiler blowdown. These
pollutants were identified primarily through documentation in MassDEP's records for this facility
under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan and/or EPA Region 1’s Remediation General Permit
although a review of former operations at the facility that may have impacted soil or
groundwater and the nature of process discharges was also done. In this review, EPA identified
chromium and cyanide as pollutants of concern related to identical types of discharges, including
hydrostatic test water, covered under EPA’s Remediation General Permit. EPA noted in the
permits’ fact sheets that chromium had also been included in Whole Effluent Toxicity testing
prior to the recent protocol revision. As the facility did not conduct this testing prior to the
revision, based on testing at nearby facilities, this parameter was maintained. Cyanide was
further noted in EPA’s review of records for this facility under the Massachusetts Contingency
Plan given the releases of fuel oils and the parameters limited for this type of release under
EPA’s Remediation General Permit. Phthalates were noted in EPA’s review of past operations,
given the former use as a coal storage facility and the association between phthalates and coal.
Phthalates, along with multiple metals, nitrogen and phosphorus, were also noted in the
compositional characteristics of boiler blowdown, an effluent stream from the facility for which
EPA otherwise lacks monitoring data.49 Metals and nutrients are discussed further, below.
Fourth, EPA thoroughly reviewed the development document published for National Effluent
Limitations Guidelines for the petroleum refining point-source category, for which Bulk
Petroleum Storage Terminals and Stations were considered for inclusion,50 and supporting
documents for similar industrial sectors, including the Steam Electric Power Point Source
Category, in which multiple pollutants of concern are identified in effluents from bulk petroleum
storage facilities and are present in petroleum products stored at these types of facilities.51
Supplemental pollutant-specific information, as noted in the permits’ fact sheets, was also
reviewed as needed.52 In review of these documents and supplemental information, EPA
identified cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, nickel, phenol and zinc as pollutants of
concern, which are present in petroleum products.53
Finally, EPA considered pollutants for which the Chelsea River is impaired, but no effluent data
have been collected, particularly given the changes to the 303(d) listing for Chelsea River
segment MA71-06 since the issuance of the current permit. In this review, EPA identified
ammonia and fecal coliform as pollutants of concern. In the Final 2012 Massachusetts Impaired
Waters List (303(d) list) approved by EPA in May 2013, MassDEP identified over two thousand
impairments in over seven hundred water body segments still requiring TMDLs. Roughly half of

these impairment-water body segment combinations were related to stormwater pollution,
including, but not limited to, impairments for bacteria, excess algal growth, nutrients,
sedimentation, and dissolved oxygen. Urban stormwater runoff, like that which is discharged
from the facility, is well documented as a leading cause of impairment of freshwater lakes,
rivers, and estuaries.54 Further, multiple pollutants of concern are contained in urban stormwater
runoff like that which is discharged from the facility, including the following major constituents:
nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), bacteria/pathogens, chloride, solids, oil & grease
(hydrocarbons), and metals.55
Once the pollutants of concern were identified, EPA determined applicable technology-based
limits and appropriate WQBELs. The draft permit limits reflect whichever limits (technologybased or water quality-based) are more stringent. Where EPA was unable to determine if certain
parameters had reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above water quality
criteria because of a significant lack of information, as was the case for chromium, iron, cyanide,
phenol, phthalates, ammonia and fecal coliform noted above, the draft permits require
monitoring, without limits.
Because chromium, iron, cyanide, phenol, phthalates, ammonia and fecal coliform have not
previously been monitored in the facility’s discharges or available monitoring data are
insufficient for EPA to make a definitive determination, and as the commenter has submitted no
quantitative factual basis demonstrating that these pollutants are not present at the facility at
levels that cause or have reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above water
quality criteria, EPA cannot assume they are absent given the types of materials stored at the
facility (e.g., fuel oil), historical uses at the facility (e.g., coal storage), processes at the facility
(e.g., hydrostatic testing and boiler blowdown), and/or pollutants identified as causing
impairments to the receiving water (e.g., petroleum hydrocarbons, un-ionized ammonia and fecal
coliform). Section 308(a)(3)(A) of the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to require reports,
monitoring equipment or methods, expanded sampling, or any other information that would help
establish or determine compliance with effluent limits, prohibitions, effluent standards,
pretreatment standards, or standards of performance under the Clean Water Act. EPA determined
further monitoring is necessary in order to evaluate the effluent from the facility with regard to
certain pollutants associated with petroleum products and urban industrial sites. Further, EPA has
required the facility to gather more data to ensure the stormwater discharges do not impact the
water quality of the Chelsea River or pose a risk to human health or the environment. Therefore,
the additional monitoring requirements in the permits are included for specific regulatory use in
carrying out the Clean Water Act. EPA's ability to exercise its legitimate regulatory authority
granted in Section 308 to gather information in order to determine the concentrations of
pollutants discharging into the Chelsea River at the facility is of paramount importance to human
health and the environment. EPA’s decision to include industry-specific, site-specific and/or
receiving water-specific parameters in the permit is reasonable and consistent with its
responsibilities under the Act, particularly given the highly urbanized nature of the watershed
above the discharge and the nature of impairments in the receiving water. EPA expects the
frequency of this sampling to reduce with time, assuming pollutants are not detected.

With regard to item B., when determining whether there is reasonable potential for a discharge to
cause or contribute to an excursion from water quality standards, EPA uses three approaches:
biological assessment, chemical specific criteria, and WET testing. Since each type of approach
has different sensitivities and purposes, a particular approach may fail to detect impairments
when used alone. As a result, these methods are used together in an integrated water quality
assessment, each providing an independent evaluation of nonattainment of a designated use.
Therefore, if any one type of criterion indicates impairment of the surface water, regulatory
action can be taken to improve water quality. WET testing is used to determine the aggregate
toxic effect to aquatic organisms from all pollutants contained in a facility's wastewater effluent.
The existing tests, as provided by agency regulation and guidance, are appropriate indicators of
toxicity associated with the discharges. Further, MassDEP’s Implementation Policy for the
Control of Toxic Pollutants in Surface Waters includes whole effluent testing requirements as
part of its interpretation of the narrative criteria. Specifically, WET testing is used to ensure the
aquatic life criteria are met with respect to effluents that could contain chemicals that may be
overlooked in chemical-specific testing, chemical that have additive, synergistic or antagonistic
effects, or toxic pollutants with variable bioavailability. Despite the likelihood that all of the
noted instances apply to the facility’s discharges based on the characteristics of the pollutants of
concern, WET testing has not been previously required at the facility. As a result, EPA is unable
to determine if limitations for toxicity are necessary to meet water quality standards. Given the
impairments to the Chelsea River and the pollutants and sources identified in support of the
listing for these impairments, EPA determined that WET testing is warranted. Further, WET
testing addresses the monitoring need for additional pollutants of concern identified above,
which were not individually required in the Pollutant Scan.
A single sample, such as the Permittee suggests, is not sufficient to determine effluent variability
or make an informed decision regarding compliance with water quality standards. In response to
comments received, EPA has increased the WET test frequency for the first three years of the
permit term. Three years represents EPA’s Technical Support Document for Water Qualitybased Toxics Control recommendation for ascertaining the attainment of both acute and chronic
effect for both chemical-specific and whole effluent approaches,56 the recommendation for a
minimum data set of 8 to 12 samples for evaluation of pollutants of concern57 and 10 or more
samples for statistical analysis.58 However, after this period, EPA agrees that WET testing
frequency may be reduced or eliminated. The final permit specifies the requirements for such
reduction or elimination, namely, elimination is not warranted if WET testing is not completed
using the receiving water as the diluent. While an alternate dilution water can still demonstrate
the effect of the effluent alone, use of the receiving water can demonstrate the effect of the
effluent in combination with existing conditions, which EPA believes is necessary to ensure
compliance with water quality standards given the impaired status of the Chelsea River.
With regard to item C., the establishment of new effluent limitations in the permit for indicator
parameters, required at a monitoring frequency of monthly, are based on the impairments to
designated uses for the Chelsea River and updated assessment information for the receiving

water, pertaining to limitations for the indicator parameters for petroleum/petroleum
hydrocarbons, benzene, benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene. Until these limits go into effect, and
the permittee has incorporated the additional requirements in the permit, particularly as they
pertain to Best Management Practices, a determination of effluent quality is incomplete.
Furthermore, non-conventional parameters required at a monthly monitoring frequency have
been continued from the current permit. Reductions in monitoring frequencies are not warranted
when a permittee has not demonstrated compliance with effluent limitations, nor are reductions
warranted below a frequency necessary to determine compliance. As noted in Response to
Comment B3 above, a monitoring frequency of quarterly does not yield data with an expected
level of confidence sufficient to evaluate compliance with water quality standards. In addition, in
order for EPA to determine the long-term average of these parameters in accordance with
guidance set forth in the Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control
(EPA/505/2-90-001), a minimum of three years of data is recommended. Further, EPA does not
believe quarterly sampling for toxic pollutants limited by human health criteria is sufficient to
determine compliance with water quality standards where the compliance measure is an average
monthly limit set equal to the criterion, particularly since analytical measurements cannot
demonstrate that effluent concentrations do not exceed the limitation. EPA’s Interim Guidance
for Performance-Based Reduction of NPDES Permit Monitoring Frequencies advises that where
an effluent limitation is less than the capability for measuring a pollutant, as well as the instance
where a discharge is of significant human health concern, such as where limitations based on
human health criteria are necessary to meet water quality standards, no monitoring frequency
reductions be allowed.
Further, quarterly monitoring does not adequately characterize effluent variability of intermittent,
short-term and/or batch discharges where the standard deviation is relatively high and the
coefficient of variation (ratio of standard deviation to the mean) cannot be reasonably estimated.
Further, decreasing the number of samples only increases the uncertainty associated with this
variability and thusly the uncertainty that the corresponding limit is actually being attained.
EPA’s Interim Guidance for Performance-Based Reduction of NPDES Permit Monitoring
Frequencies describes that for data exhibiting a coefficient of variation (ratio of standard
deviation to the mean) of 0.20 or less and no monthly average limit violation for the appropriate
averaging period, which is recommended for a minimum two year period, except where effluent
data have not been continuously reported or which is interrupted or discontinuous, intermittent,
short-term, or based on batch discharges, less frequent monitoring can be appropriate to
determine compliance with a limit, reductions may be considered. Where effluent data are
intermittent (as is the case for stormwater discharges), short-term (as is the case for hydrostatic
test water discharges), or batch (as are groundwater remediation effluent and boiler blowdown
discharges), more than two years of effluent data are recommended. As noted above, EPA’s TSD
recommends a three year return interval, noted as roughly equivalent to a 7Q10 design flow
condition with some consideration of rates of ecological recovery from a variety of severe
stresses. Therefore, the monthly frequency for these parameters remain unchanged and no
monitoring frequency reductions may be considered for a minimum of the first three years
following the effective date of the permit.
In sum, EPA believes that the effluent limits, monitoring requirements, and non-numeric TBELs,
including BMPs, are the appropriate means to effectively characterize discharges from the
59

facility and provide the information needed to determine if additional permit conditions are
necessary to ensure compliance with water quality standards. However, EPA agrees that
monitoring frequency for certain pollutants required in the effluent pollutant scan and/or whole
effluent toxicity testing may be reduced or eliminated after collection of representative data.
Since EPA has increased the sampling frequency of the parameters related to the pollutant scan
and whole effluent toxicity testing (see Response to Comment B3 and Response to Comment C2,
above), the final permits include the provision for reduction or elimination in monitoring
frequencies of non-limited pollutants and reduction in monitoring frequencies for limited
pollutants after the first three years following the effective date of the permit, provided sampling
results meet eligibility requirements. As described, three years represents the minimum long term
averaging period EPA uses in accordance with EPA’s Technical Support Document for Water
Quality-based Toxics Control and generates the minimum number of recommended samples for
evaluating pollutants of concern.
The final permits do not include automatic reductions in the testing frequency of limited
parameters, however, as EPA believes it appropriate to evaluate compliance on a parameter-byparameter and case-by-case basis. For performance-based monitoring reductions, EPA follows
the Interim Guidance for Performance-Based Reduction of NPDES Permit Monitoring
Frequencies. This guidance advises a minimum two years of continuous data to determine the
long-term average, necessary to complete analyses following EPA’s TSD. Furthermore, at this
time, analytical methodologies are insufficient to determine compliance with the effluent
limitation included in the permit for benzo(a)pyrene, for which no monitoring reductions are
allowed. Therefore, EPA believes the monitoring frequencies specified in the permit must remain
in effect for a minimum of three years before performance-based monitoring reductions can be
considered. The permit specifies that the permittee may request a monitoring frequency
reduction after this period. Such a request must include rationale regarding the representativeness
of data and any measures the permittee has taken to ensure discharges of pollutants for which
monitoring reductions are requested would be expected to persist at or below levels measured in
performance data.
Comment L3:
Comment 2 – The installation of totalizers or flow meters should not be required.
EPA should amend the draft permit to continue use of the current method of determining flow
rate rather than requiring installation of flow meters at the outfall. Stormwater discharge
metering is unnecessary as the terminal impounds all stormwater before pumping to an oil/water
separator (“OWS”) prior to discharge. EPA’s intent in requiring metering, as discussed in the
fact sheets, is to ensure that flow into the OWS does not exceed the design flow capacity of the
OWS, thus rendering it ineffective. Because the rate of influent to the OWS is always controlled
by pump rates, the throughput capacity cannot be exceeded.
Chelsea Sandwich currently determines flow to the terminal’s OWS by recording the hours of
operation of the discharge pump associated with the terminal’s OWS. The hours of operation are
recorded through a timer on the discharge pump. The total discharge flow rate is then calculated
as the product of pump maximum discharge rate (capacity) and its operating time in hours. This
60

method likely overestimates the total flow rate to the OWS, keeping the actual flow in
compliance with permit discharge limits. It also ensures that the flow rate into the OWS does not
exceed the design capacity. As the terminal flows have not exceeded the design capacity of the
OWS at any facility, installation of the flow meters is not necessary.
In addition, Chelsea Sandwich notes that installation of a totalizer, which would measure the
total output of a certain discharge over a period of time (for instance, a month), would not
provide any safeguard against an exceedance of the design capacity of the OWS. Rather, a
totalizer would just provide the total volume that was discharged.
Finally, Chelsea Sandwich has concerns that installing totalizers on the flow would be ineffective
due to blockages, freezing or calibration issues. Such mechanical issues will not provide the
required assurances that OWS design capacity has not been exceeded, which appears to the goal
of EPA as stated in the fact sheet.
EPA should amend the draft permit and allow the flow rate to be calculated in the same manner
as the 2005 permit. Chelsea Sandwich will continue to maintain records regarding flow rates, and
will notify EPA of any modification to the impoundment system that would result in changes to
the discharge to the OWS. This method will continue to allow for proper operation of the OWS
and keep flow into the OWS below design limitations.
Response to Comment L3:
The commenter misunderstands the permits’ fact sheet. Section 7.1 of the fact sheet for the draft
permit (page 14) states, “During the 2005 Permit term, a flow meter was installed to record the
volume of treated effluent discharged via Outfall 001. The Draft Permit has added a requirement
that the flow rate and total flow continues to be measured using such a device.” EPA maintained
the daily maximum flow rate limit to ensure the design flow capacity of the OWS is not
exceeded. As flow rates are typically estimated using pump curves, the final permits have
clarified that the use of a flow meter is not required for recording the flow rate of discharges.
However, the requirement for use of a flow meter remains in the final permits for recording the
total flow. Chelsea Sandwich stated in its application that a flow meter was installed during the
previous permit term to determine the actual volume of effluent discharged through Outfall 001
(see Page 13 of tab number 3 of the renewal application). The permit requirement to continue use
of this flow meter was incorporated to continue collection of actual volume information. This
information is critical to evaluation of pollutant loading from the facility to the receiving water to
ensure that the discharges do not cause or contribute to an excursion above water quality
standards.
EPA is aware of multiple bulk petroleum storage facilities in the Boston Harbor drainage system
that utilize flow meters to monitor their effluent and have not reported such devices to be
ineffective due to blockages, freezing or calibration issues. The various specifications in widely
available devices indicate that multiple types of meters are capable of recording the required
parameter with minimal maintenance. However, EPA understands that the facility may not
utilize a flow meter that satisfies the requirement of the permit. Therefore, the Final Permit
61

stipulates that the facility will have 180 days from the effective date of the permit to modify their
current device and/or configuration, if needed. In the interim, the permittee may continue to
report the flow rate and total flow as an estimate, determined using the method described in the
comment. Notification regarding the completion of device and/or configuration changes is also
required.
Comment L4:
Comment 3 – EPA should clarify the bases for reopening a permit.
The final permit should provide for notice and comment by the permit holder prior to EPA
reopening a final permit. The draft permits each contain a reopener clause that allows
modification to the permits at any time pursuant to 40 C.F.R. §122.62. Section 122.62 provides
wide-ranging authority to reopen a permit for modification, including among other things
substantial alteration to a facility, new information regarding operations, promulgation of new
standards or regulations, judicial decision and detection of non-limited pollutants above levels
that can be achieved by appropriate technology-based treatment methods. A modification can be
either minor, which does not require a new draft permit or public comment period upon the
consent of the permittee, or require the more burdensome issuance of a new draft permit if the
modification does not qualify as minor under 40 C.F.R. §122.63. Section 122.62 also allows
reopening in limited circumstances, such as noncompliance, for revocation or reissuance.
As Section 122.62 provides wide discretion for EPA to reopen the permits for a wide variety of
reasons, the final permit should contain a provision that EPA will notify a permit holder prior to
reopening a permit, allowing for discussion and comments on the rationale for reopening, the
nature of proposed revisions and the potential to resolve a proposed revision as a minor
modification, prior to a decision to issue a draft permit or open the matter to the public.
Response to Comment L4:
Federal regulations pertaining to permit modification, revocation and reissuance, and termination
are found at 40 C.F.R. §§122.62, 122.63, 122.64, and 124.5. In most cases, a permit will not
need to be modified (or revoked and reissued) during the term of the permit.
Permit modifications are limited to specific causes identified in §§122.62(a) and 122.62(b), most
of which are summarized in Exhibit 11-10 in Section 11.4.2 of EPA’s NPDES Permit Writer’s
Manual.59 Most NPDES permit modifications require the public notice and participation
activities of Part 124, similar to the issuance or reissuance of the permit; however, only those
specific conditions being modified are open to review and comment. Modifications differ from
revocations and reissuance. In a permit modification, only the conditions subject to change are
reconsidered while all other permit conditions remain in effect. Conversely, the entire permit
could be reconsidered when it is revoked and reissued. The permitting authority may revoke and
reissue a permit during its term for the causes identified in §122.62(b). EPA informs the
permittee prior to major modification, revocation and/or reissuance and discussion, to the extent
appropriate and allowable by law, may occur.

There are certain minor modifications that, upon consent of the permittee, may be processed by
the permitting authority without following the procedures for public notice in Part 124. Minor
modifications are generally non-substantive changes (e.g., correction of typographical errors,
incorporate more frequent monitoring or reporting, delete a point source outfall when that outfall
is terminated, and to record a change in ownership) and are exempt from the administrative
procedures; that is, a draft permit and public review are not required. The specific permit
changes that can be processed as minor modifications are described in §122.63.
Comment L5:
Comment 4 – EPA should provide a concise definition of PQL.
EPA should define PQL as it is used in the draft permits. For example, during the April 17, 2014
informational meeting and public hearing on the draft permits, EPA stated the proposed
benzo(a)pyrene compliance limit is the detection limit and not the number (0.018 µg/L) which is
provided in the Effluent Limitation and Monitoring Requirements.
Chelsea Sandwich has concerns regarding certifying discharge monitoring reports as being
compliant when the required laboratory analyses cannot meet the Effluent Limitation. The
reporting of an amount above the actual discharge limitation, but below the MDL, will result in
confusion, potential issues with NetDMR and the potential for a discharge to be found out of
compliance.
As the proposed Limitation and Monitoring Requirement is in some instances below the
detection limit, EPA should adopt the present method detection limits as the effluent limits. EPA
can then amend the discharge limit as sample technology improves, thus lowering the detection
limits.
Response to Comment L5:
EPA refers to the “detection limit” in the draft permits and fact sheets as a practical quantitation
limit (“PQL”). The definition of the PQL, as it is being used, is the lowest concentration that can
be reliably measured within specified limits of precision and accuracy for a specific laboratory
analytical method during routine laboratory operating conditions. The PQL is a measured value
equal to or greater than the method detection limit (“MDL”), the level at which an analyte can be
measured and reported with 99-percent confidence that the concentration of the analyte is greater
than zero. EPA does not refer to the MDL in the permits or fact sheets. However, PQL can be
used to refer to a specific multiple of the MDL. The Federal Advisory Committee on Detection
and Quantitation Approaches,60 proposed the conceptually equivalent term, detection limit
(“DL”), to refer to the lowest result that can be reliably distinguished from a blank and is the
normal censoring limit for analytical result reporting (i.e., a result at or above the DL is reported
as a specific value where a result below the DL is reported as having not been detected). EPA
has retained the term PQL in the final permits and has added a concise definition to be

complimentary to the inclusion of the concise definition of minimum level (“ML”) included in
the draft permits.
It is unclear when EPA referred to the compliance limit for benzo(a)pyrene as being the
“detection limit”. This statement did not occur during the public hearing as it is not part of the
hearing transcript included in the administrative record. The compliance level for benzo(a)pyrene
is not specified as the PQL in any of the seven permits. Rather, the compliance level for
benzo(a)pyrene is specified as the ML as recommended in EPA’s Technical Support Document
for Water Quality-based Toxics Control. Further, the compliance level for all parameters with
numeric effluent limitations, if different from the numeric limit, is specified in all seven permits
as the ML. The ML is not a measurement, but the acceptable minimum calibration point for
analysis.
Compliance levels are specified in all seven permits for benzo(a)pyrene and in the Global
REVCO, LLC permit for oil & grease, benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, and naphthalene for Outfall
005. For this facility, an ML is specified as the compliance level in the footnotes in Part I.A. of
the permits for benzo(a)pyrene. PQLs do not apply to any effluent limitation in any of the
permits, with the exception of Outfall 005, Global REVCO, LLC. Where the PQL is equal to the
numeric limit, a compliance level is also specified. EPA guidance recommends use of the ML for
compliance purposes when a permit limitation is less than the PQL, as is the case for Global
REVCO, LLC. Outfall 005. MLs and/or PQLs, but not compliance levels, are specified for
analysis of monitoring-only parameters included in the Whole Effluent Toxicity testing and
Pollutant Scan, to ensure the permittee uses sufficiently sensitive analytical methods for sample
analysis.
EPA has included the limitations, minimum levels, compliance levels, PQLs, and/or analytical
methods as specified in EPA guidance.61 For benzo(a)pyrene, provided the permittee meets the
compliance level specified in the permits, discharges are not considered violations. As in the
example noted in the comment where an “estimated value” is reported by an analytical
laboratory when an analyte is detected below the PQL, 0.05 µg/L, the estimated value may be
above the limit, 0.018 µg/L but will be below the compliance level (i.e., ML), 0.1 µg/L, so is not
be considered a violation. If a result is below the PQL, 0.05 µg/L, and no estimated value is
given, the required value to be reported is <0.05 µg/L. While potentially above the limit, 0.018
µg/L, this is below the compliance level, 0.1 µg/L, so it is not considered a violation. Similarly,
if a value is above the PQL, 0.05 µg/L, but below the compliance level, 0.1 µg/L, while this is
above the limit, 0.018 µg/L, it is not considered a violation. However, if a value is reported
above the compliance level, 0.1 µg/L, it is a violation. The final permits include the applicable
terms in the footnotes in Part I.A., including the applicable compliance level, where necessary.
Comment L6:
Comment 5 – EPA should relieve permit holders from accounting for background chemicals in
pretreated City water.

61

See EPA/505/2-90-001, March 1991.

64

Chelsea Sandwich uses water directly from the City for hydrostatic testing at the terminal.
Because this water is pretreated to state drinking water standards, Chelsea Sandwich requests
that the final permits relieve Chelsea Sandwich from any requirements to account for
background chemical concentrations detected in the incoming water.
Response to Comment L6:
EPA agrees that the municipal water supply is not likely to contain the majority of pollutants of
concern for the facility and receiving water. Therefore, influent testing is required only in the
instance where municipal water supply is not the fill source. However, several pollutants of
concern are known to be present in municipal water supplies in Massachusetts that are pollutants
of concern for the facility and receiving water. Therefore, EPA has retained monitoring for
certain parameters when potable water supply is used for testing. The monitoring requirement for
influent has been modified where municipal water supply is used in hydrostatic testing, (Part
I.A.15.).
Therefore, the only additional pollutant retained for effluent monitoring when municipal water
supply is used for the source water in hydrostatic testing is total residual chlorine. 40 C.F.R.
§141.72 stipulates that a public water system’s residual disinfectant concentration in the water
entering the distribution system cannot be less than 0.2 mg/l for more than 4 hours. Chlorine and
chlorine compounds can be extremely toxic to aquatic life. Massachusetts WQSs require the use
of federal WQC where a specific pollutant could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
existing or designated uses (314 C.M.R. 4.05 (5)(e)). The National Recommended freshwater
acute and chronic WQC for total residual chlorine are 19 µg/L (0.019 mg/L), and 11 µg/L (0.011
mg/L), respectively. Since discharges from the facility receive no dilution under critical low flow
conditions, EPA believes monitoring for TRC is necessary to ensure residual concentrations are
not discharged to the Chelsea River.
Further, in Response to Comment B7, EPA has increased the effluent sampling requirements
following treatment of hydrostatic test water and eliminated in-process testing requirements (also
see Response to Comment R2). If the permittee utilizes municipal water supply for hydrostatic
testing, the total number of samples required in the final permits for hydrostatic testing
represents a net decrease relative to the total number of samples required for hydrostatic testing
in the draft permits.
Comment L7:
Comment 6 – EPA should exempt treated surface or groundwater from the requirements of
Section 1.B.
EPA should exempt treated surface or groundwater from the requirements of Section 1.B of the
draft permits when, after a treatment with “activated carbon absorption” or similar method, the
water meets the discharge limitations and criteria of the permits.
Response to Comment L7:

65

Part I.B. serves two critical purposes. The first purpose of Part I.B. is to define several allowable
non-stormwater discharges that would be expected to be generated during normal operations at
the facility. EPA has refined the heading for Part I.B. to reflect these “additional allowable
discharges”.
The second purpose of Part I.B. is to prohibit any discharges that are not otherwise permitted in
Part I.A. Treated stormwater and groundwater are both permitted discharges under Part I.A.
subject to the effluent limitations and monitoring requirements specified. Similarly, if additional
groundwater remediation effluent other than that authorized in Part I.A. has not been requested,
such a discharge is prohibited.
Comment L8:
Comment 7 – The final permits should acknowledge that naturally-occurring rainwater in New
England exceeds EPA’s proposed discharge limitations and allow for submittal of data should a
discharge exceed the pH discharge limits.
While the discharge from the terminal has historically met the discharge limits for pH, Chelsea
Sandwich is concerned about the more stringent discharge limits for pH in the draft permits.
National Atmospheric Deposition Program (“NADP”) data shows that rainwater in the New
England region often has a pH below the proposed discharge limitation of 6.5-8.5 S.U. (see
attached Exhibit A). Based on the NADP data, it appears that rainwater in New England
contains pH levels below 6.0 S.U.
As the Chelsea Sandwich terminal is a petroleum storage and distribution facility, there are no
processes that alter pH. It appears that some level of natural buffering occurs, resulting in pH in
stormwater above 6.0 S.U., due to contact with soils and impermeable surfaces at the terminals.
However, as this natural buffering is limited and outside the control of Chelsea Sandwich, EPA
should acknowledge that the pH of rainwater in this area is acidic, and that this is a natural
condition that impacts the stormwater discharge.
The draft permits should be modified to include that a discharge below 6.5 S.U. or evidence that
the receiving waterbody’s pH level fluctuated more than 0.2 S.U. during a storm event do not
constitute a violation of the permits. Further, Chelsea Sandwich suggests that EPA allow for
collection of rainwater for analysis and submittal to EPA where pH ranges in the discharge may
be more acidic than allowed.
Response to Comment L8:
EPA acknowledges that rainwater in New England is often acidic and may affect the pH of
stormwater discharges from industrial facilities. The requirement at Part I.A.4. of the permit
states that “The pH of the effluent shall be neither less than 6.5 SU nor greater than 8.5 SU at any
time, unless these values are exceeded due to natural causes”. This requirement is based on the
Massachusetts’ WQSs (see 314 C.M.R. 4.05(4)(b)(3)) and takes into account that changes in pH
might not be attributed to an on-site operation. This requirement shall be retained in the final
permits.
66

EPA agrees that the pH of the discharge at Chelsea Sandwich can be attributed to the low pH of
rainfall. EPA may take the effects of acidic rainfall into account when evaluating compliance
with the permit’s pH requirements. However, for discharge samples whose pH falls below 6.5
SU, EPA suggests that the facility collect rainwater samples from the same storm event and
record the pH. This will provide data documenting the low pH of the stormwater as a possible
source of the low pH of the discharge. However, no modification to the permit limitations for pH
have been made, as the pH limitations apply to all Class SB waterbodies, including Chelsea
River. A provision for this allowance has been added to the above footnote in the final permit.
Comments submitted which pertain to Global REVCO Terminal (#MA0003298):
Comments submitted by Michael A. Leon, Nutter, McClennen & Fish, LLP, on behalf of
Global REVCO Terminal, LLC:
Comment M1:
Global appreciates the enormous effort that EPA devoted to preparing the draft permit, and finds
that much of the content is reasonable and appropriate. Global believes, however, that certain
provisions are inapt particularly in considering presently available information regarding the
terminal.
In the balance of this letter, Global identifies the modifications it believes appropriate, and
explains the bases for each.
Response to Comment M1:
EPA notes the comment.
Comment M2:
Comment 1 – The new proposed discharge limits for Outfall 005 should be suspended pending
an evaluation of the flow direction in the area of the discharge.
The proposed discharge limits from Outfall 005, which constitute a significant change from the
2005 permit, should be suspended pending further study to determine the actual flow of the
receiving waterbody segment and whether the discharge impacts Sales Creek.
While the draft permit for the Global REVCO terminal indicates that Outfall 005 discharges to
Sales Creek, the discharge is actually to a small swale adjacent to the terminal. Available data
from the City of Revere (attached at Exhibit A62) indicates that the water in the swale flows away
from Sales Creek into man-made retention basins associated with the adjacent commercial
development.

The figure is developed from GIS data collected for the City of Revere by CDM Smith, the City’s consulting
engineer.
62

67

There are two potential flow patterns for discharged stormwater from Outfall 005. It may flow
to the west and north towards Sales Creek, then east around the adjacent new shopping mall
development. Alternatively, the flow may be to the east along the swale to a series of retention
basins that appear to have been constructed to retain stormwater runoff from the new shopping
mall. As shown on Exhibit A, the flow direction where the swale meets Sales Creek appears to
be away from Sales Creek, towards the terminal and the discharge point. In addition, flow at the
southeasterly terminus of the swale also shows the flow away from Sales Creek.
In order to determine the actual flow direction of the discharge, Global suggests that the
discharge limits for Outfall 005 be suspended for one year while Global undertakes a study to
determine the actual flow direction in the swale. This will enable Global to determine if the flow
goes to the adjacent retention basins, where it is infiltrated, or if some amount of the discharge
flows northerly along the swale to Sales Creek. Until flow direction is known, EPA is unable to
provide legally tenable discharge limitations based upon impacts to the receiving waterbody.
In addition, the more stringent proposed discharge limits are a result of Sales Creek’s present
designation as a Class SA/ORW waterbody because it is a tributary to Belle Isle Inlet. However,
EPA acknowledges in the fact sheet that MassDEP will likely reclassify Sales Creek in the
future. EPA quotes MassDEP by stating that “although Sales Creek is currently classified in the
SWQS as a Class SA/ORW since it is a tributary to Belle Isle Inlet, [Sales Creek] is separated
from Belle Isle Inlet by a tide gate and does not function as a tidal system. It is recommended
that this waterbody be reclassified in the next revision of the SWQS as a Class B/ORW
waterbody.” Because MassDEP has indicated that Sales Creek will be classified as a Class B
waterbody, the discharge limitations should remain the same as in the 2005 permit.
Response to Comment M2:
The Permittee may undertake the hydrologic study described above if the Permittee believes the
information provided to EPA in its permit application and the basis for the existing permit is no
longer accurate. However, the Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters
of the United States without an NPDES permit. Clean Water Act §402; 33 U.S.C. §1342. EPA
develops appropriate permit conditions based on information available at the time of permit
issuance.
Regarding the classification of Sales Creek, 40 C.F.R. §131 establishes the requirements for
states and tribes to review, revise, and adopt water quality standards. It also establishes the
procedures for EPA to review, approve, disapprove, and promulgate water quality standards
pursuant to section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act. Water quality standards consist of: 1)
designated uses; 2) water quality criteria; 3) an anti-degradation policy; and 4) general policies.
Sales Creek itself is a small waterbody, including unnamed hydrologic tributaries, that flows to
Belle Isle Inlet and into Winthrop Bay (Segment MA71-12) defined in 314 C.M.R. 4.06 as
“Belle Isle inlet and tributaries thereto”. It is classified as a SA/ORW waterbody, including
Shellfishing, and consists of 0.008 square miles between its headwaters near Route 145, Revere,
to a tide gate at the confluence with Belle Isle Inlet, in East Boston/Revere. The outfall location,
as noted, is adjacent to one of several hydrologic features in the vicinity of Route 145. As such,
information provided to date does not demonstrate that this discharge is not to Sales Creek.

68

Class SA waters are described in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ WQSs (314 C.M.R.
4.05(4)(a)) as follows: “These waters are designated as an excellent habitat for fish, other
aquatic life and wildlife, including for their reproduction, migration, growth and other critical
functions, and for primary and secondary contact recreation. In certain waters, excellent habitat
for fish, other aquatic life and wildlife may include, but is not limited to, seagrass. Where
designated in the tables to 314 C.M.R. 4.00 for shellfishing, these waters shall be suitable for
shellfish harvesting without depuration (Approved and Conditionally Approved Shellfish Areas).
These waters shall have excellent aesthetic value.” Sales Creek is listed as Category 3 “No Uses
Assessed” on the Final Massachusetts Year 2012 Integrated List of Waters. MassDEP noted in
an errata sheet to the most recent WQR for the Mystic River Watershed (2010)63 that “although
Sales Creek is currently classified in the SWQS as a Class SA/ORW since it is a tributary to Belle
Isle Inlet, it is separated from Belle Isle Inlet by a tide gate and does not function as a tidal
system. It is recommended that this waterbody be reclassified in the next revision of the SWQS as
a Class B/ORW.” This correction does not state that MassDEP “will likely reclassify Sales
Creek”, as the commenter states. Until the State formally reclassifies Sales Creek to a Class
B/ORW waterbody, the Draft Permit must contain limitations to meet water quality standards
applicable to Class SA/ORW. As a result, EPA is unable to maintain the 2005 permit limitations
as requested.
Comment M3:
Comment 2 – WET testing of the Outfall 005 discharge should be suspended.
For the pollutant scan and WET test, the draft permit requires that the receiving water sample be
collected from Sales Creek at a point immediately outside of Outfall 005’s zone of influence.
However, as discussed in Comment 1, Outfall 005 does not discharge directly to Sales Creek,
and it is unclear what the zone of influence would encompass. This sampling should be
suspended until completion of the proposed hydrological study discussed in Comment 1 is
completed. At that time, it will be clear whether discharge from Outfall 005 impacts Sales Creek
and what type of sampling and discharge limits are necessary.
In addition, Global notes that the flow into the swale is intermittent. As such, if Sales Creek is
determined to be the receiving waterbody, EPA should recognize that WET testing of a tributary
to Sales Creek can only occur when there is water present. EPA should amend the draft permit to
include that WET testing is not required when the receiving waterbody is dry.
Response to Comment M3:
See Response to Comment M2 regarding EPA’s ability to stay permit requirements in this
instance.
With regard to the intermittent nature of the receiving water, EPA agrees that sampling the
receiving water as required is not feasible during dry periods. EPA has added a provision to the
Errata Sheet: Mystic River 2004-2008 Water Quality Assessment Report available at
http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/water/watersheds/mystic-river-2004-2008-water-quality-assessmentreport.html.

final permit regarding sampling limitations for the receiving water. Standard provisions for use
of an alternate dilution water also remain. A No Data Indicator Code should be used when a
permittee is unable to sample because of receiving water conditions and such a code applies
(e.g., F – Insufficient Flow for Sampling and 5 – Frozen Conditions).
Comment M4:
Comment 3 – The proposed discharge limits and sample parameters must be related to the
discharge reasonably expected from a facility.
EPA must have a rational basis for determining a facility’s discharge limits and sampling
parameters. EPA improperly relies upon Section 308 of the Clean Water Act to provide authority
to require reporting of information necessary to establish appropriate discharge limits. EPA,
through reporting requirements, seeks to determine if discharge limitations are necessary in the
future. However, the basis for establishing reporting requirements should be to limit and treat the
constituents known to exist in the groundwater, soil and other surficial areas at a facility or the
discharge from that facility that may impact the receiving waterbody. The sampling parameters
and frequency should not encompass potential substances that have no connection to the
discharge, have not been detected at a facility, are not in use at or in processes at a facility, or
which are not under the control of a permitted operator. The following changes should be made
to the final permits.
A. Monitoring for chromium, iron, cyanide, phenol, ammonia and fecal coliform should
be deleted.
 Chromium, cyanide and phenols are generally emitted by coating or plating
processes. Global is unaware of any historic process at the terminal that used
these constituents, or of any sample data that suggests these constituents are
present in the stormwater discharge from the terminal. As these substances are not
actually present at the terminal and are not used or stored at the terminal, there is
no basis to require testing for them.
 Global is unaware of any past process activities that released iron at the terminal.
As noted by EPA in the facts sheets, iron occurs naturally in the soils in the area.
As there is no evidence that iron impacts the stormwater discharge above
expected background levels, there is no basis to require testing for iron.
 Fecal coliform testing should not be required as there are no sanitary discharges to
any of the outfalls at the terminal. While the Chelsea River is impaired for its
designated uses, and fecal coliform is a pollutant requiring a TMDL, there is no
evidence to suggest that the terminal is or has been a source.
 Should EPA elect to not adopt Global’s above approach, Global proposes in the
alternative that the sampling for these constituents be conducted in the first year,
but for each constituent that is not detected above background levels, nothing
thereafter.
B. If, following the first required WET Test, it is shown that the discharge from the
terminal has the same or greater survivability of the target species than that of the
Receiving Water (Chelsea Creek), the proposed annual testing should be changed to
require testing only every three years.
70

C. The frequency of any monthly sample parameter reported by the analyzing laboratory
as not detected in a given discharge over a twelve (12) month sampling period should
be automatically amended to require only quarterly sampling.
Response to Comment M4:
See Response to Comment L2, as the comment is substantially identical. EPA notes that
monitoring for cyanide was not included in the draft permit for this facility as this pollutant was
not identified as a pollutant of concern inasmuch as the facility has a different operational history
from that of the Chelsea Sandwich Terminal and Sunoco Logistics Terminal. In addition, while
verifying the parameters included in the pollutant scan based on review of the permittee’s permit
renewal application and in review of EPA’s Remediation General Permit and/or EPA’s
Technical Support Document for the 2004 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan, EPA identified
additional pollutants of concern under these categories. Also noted are pollutants required for
this permit which are not described in Response to Comment L2.
Given the impairment in the Chelsea River for taste and odor, EPA considered metals known to
cause an organoleptic effect (i.e., taste and odor), which are known or are potentially present at
the facility, but are not currently monitored. Specifically, EPA notes that iron was detected at
1,380 µg/L at Outfall 001 and 1,300 µg/L at Outfall 005 as reported in the permittee’s permit
renewal application. Both of these measurements exceed the applicable National Recommended
Water Quality Criteria organoleptic criterion for iron, 300 µg/L. Excessive amounts of iron may
also cause or contribute to violations of WQSs including those related to color, turbidity, solids,
Iron can also cause fouling of the discharge treatment systems (granular activated carbon).
However, given the limited available data, the final permit includes monitoring requirements for
total recoverable iron in conjunction with the Pollutant Scan for the effluent at Outfall 001 and
005, to determine the levels of iron in discharge. The final permit requires that total recoverable
iron be analyzed and specifies an ML for analysis.
In addition, EPA noted that lead was detected at 31.2 µg/L at Outfall 005 as reported in the
permittee’s permit renewal application. This measurement exceeds the applicable National
Recommended Water Quality Criteria saltwater chronic aquatic life criterion for lead, 8.1 µg/L.
Similarly, monitoring, without limits are required to determine if concentrations of lead cause, or
have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above applicable criteria.
However, as monitoring for lead is included in the monitoring requirements for Whole Effluent
Toxicity testing, monitoring requirements have not been duplicated in the Pollutant Scan of the
effluent.
EPA notes that tert-butyl alcohol (“TBA”) was identified as a pollutant of concern for this
facility following the process described in Response to Comment L2, but is not described in
Response to Comment L2 since TBA was not identified as a pollutant of concern for the Chelsea
Sandwich facility. TBA has been detected in surface water samples collected from the Chelsea
River. As described in the permit’s fact sheet, TBA is an oxygenate compound that has been
added to petroleum fuels to enhance their performance. TBA can be present as both a fuel
additive and as a breakdown product of MtBE in the environment. Monitoring for the compound
71

is required for sites with releases of petroleum products similar to those stored at the facility
under EPA’s Remediation General Permit.
With regard to chromium, the permittee reported in its permit renewal application a
concentration of 2.1 µg/L at Outfall 005. With regard to ammonia, the permittee reported in its
permit renewal application a concentration of 0.560 mg/L at Outfall 001 and 0.210 mg/L at
Outfall 005. The supporting rationale for these pollutants of concern does not differ from the
basis described in Response to Comment L2 and the permit’s fact sheet.
Comment M5:
Comment 4 – The installation of totalizers or flow meters should not be required.
EPA should amend the draft permit to continue use of the current method of determining flow
rate rather than requiring installation of flow meters at the outfall. Stormwater discharge
metering is unnecessary as the terminal impounds all stormwater before pumping to an oil/water
separator (“OWS”) prior to discharge. EPA’s intent in requiring metering, as discussed in the
fact sheets, is to ensure that flow into the OWS does not exceed the design flow capacity of the
OWS, thus rendering it ineffective. Because the rate of influent to the OWS is always controlled
by pump rates, the throughput capacity cannot be exceeded.
Global currently determines flow to the terminal’s OWS by recording the hours of operation of
each discharge pump associated with the terminal’s OWS. The total discharge flow rate is then
calculated as the product of pump maximum discharge rate (capacity) and its operating time in
hours. This method likely overestimates the total flow rate to the OWS, keeping the actual flow
in compliance with permit discharge limits. It also ensures that the flow rate into the OWS does
not exceed the design capacity. As the terminal flows have not exceeded the design capacity of
the OWS at any facility, installation of the flow meters is not necessary.
At the Global REVCO terminal, Global has installed restrictions that further limit the flow into
the OWS. This further prevents the possibility that the pump rate into the OWS will exceed the
design capacity of the OWS.
In addition, Global notes that addition of a totalizer, which would measure the total output of a
certain discharge over a period of time (for instance, a month), would not provide any safeguard
against an exceedance of the design capacity of the OWS. In contrast to calculating the pump
rate into the OWS and the restrictions on flow discussed above, a totalizer would just provide the
total flow volume that was discharged.
Finally, Global has concerns that installing totalizers on the flow would be ineffective due to
blockages, freezing or calibration issues. Such mechanical issues will not provide the required
assurances that OWS design capacity has not been exceeded.
EPA should amend the draft permit and allow the flow rate to be calculated in the same manner
as the 2005 permit. Global will continue to maintain records regarding flow rates, and will notify
EPA of any modification to the impoundment system that would result in changes to the
72

discharge to the OWS. This method will continue to allow for proper operation of the OWS and
keep flow into the OWS below design limitations.
Response to Comment M5:
See Response to Comment L3, as the comment is substantially identical. The permit requirement
to use a flow meter was incorporated to allow for collection of actual volume information. This
information is critical to evaluation of pollutant loading from the facility to the receiving water to
ensure that the discharges do not cause or contribute to an excursion above water quality
standards.
Comment M6:
Comment 5 – EPA should clarify the bases for reopening a permit.
The final permit should provide for notice and comment by the permit holder prior to EPA
reopening a final permit. The draft permits each contain a reopener clause that allows
modification to the permits at any time pursuant to 40 C.F.R. §122.62. Section 122.62 provides
wide-ranging authority to reopen a permit for modification, including among other things
substantial alteration to a facility, new information regarding operations, promulgation of new
standards or regulations, judicial decision and detection of non-limited pollutants above levels
that can be achieved by appropriate technology-based treatment methods. A modification can be
either minor, which does not require a new draft permit or public comment period upon the
consent of the permittee, or require the more burdensome issuance of a new draft permit if the
modification does not qualify as minor under 40 C.F.R. §122.63. Section 122.62 also allows
reopening in limited circumstances, such as noncompliance, for revocation or reissuance.
As Section 122.62 provides wide discretion for EPA to reopen the permits for a wide variety of
reasons, the final permit should contain a provision that EPA will notify a permit holder prior to
reopening a permit, allowing for discussion and comments on the rationale for reopening, the
nature of proposed revisions and the potential to resolve a proposed revision as a minor
modification, prior to a decision to issue a draft permit or open the matter to the public.
Response to Comment M6:
See Response to Comment L4, as the comment is substantially identical.
Comment M7:
Comment 6 – EPA should provide a concise definition of PQL.
EPA should define PQL as it is used in the draft permits. For example, during the April 17, 2014
informational meeting and public hearing on the draft permits, EPA stated the proposed
benzo(a)pyrene compliance limit is the detection limit and not the number (0.018 µg/L) which is
provided in the Effluent Limitation and Monitoring Requirements.

73

Global has concerns regarding certifying discharge monitoring reports as being compliant when
the required laboratory analyses cannot meet the Effluent Limitation. The reporting of an amount
above the actual discharge limitation, but below the laboratory’s detection limit, will result in
confusion, potential issues with NetDMR and the potential for a discharge to be found out of
compliance.
As the proposed Limitation and Monitoring Requirement is in some instances below the
detection limit, EPA should adopt the present laboratory detection limits as the effluent limits.
EPA can then amend the discharge limit as sample technology improves, thus lowering the
detection limits.

Comment M8:
Comment 7 – EPA should relieve permit holders from accounting for background chemicals in
pretreated City water.
Global uses water directly from the City of Revere for hydrostatic testing at the terminal.
Because this water is pretreated to state drinking water standards, Global requests that the final
permits relieve Global from any requirements to account for background chemical
concentrations detected in the incoming water.

Comment M10:

Comment 9 – The final permits should acknowledge that naturally-occurring rainwater in New
England exceeds EPA’s proposed discharge limitations and allow for submittal of data should a
discharge exceed the pH discharge limits.
While the discharge from the terminal has historically met the discharge limits for pH, Global is
concerned about the more stringent discharge limits for pH in the draft permits. National
Atmospheric Deposition Program (“NADP”) data shows that rainwater in the New England
region often has a pH below the proposed discharge limitation of 6.5-8.5 S.U. (see attached
Exhibit B). Based on the NADP data, it appears that rainwater in New England contains pH
levels below 6.0 S.U.
As the Global terminal is a petroleum storage and distribution facility, there are no processes that
alter pH. It appears that some level of natural buffering occurs, resulting in pH in stormwater
above 6.0 S.U., due to contact with soils and impermeable surfaces at the terminal. However, as
this natural buffering is limited and outside the control of Global, EPA should acknowledge that
the pH of rainwater in this area is acidic, and that this is a natural condition that impacts the
stormwater discharge.
The draft permit should be modified to include that a discharge below 6.5 S.U. or evidence that
the receiving waterbody’s pH level fluctuated more than 0.2 S.U. during a storm event do not
constitute a violation of the permits. Further, Global suggests that EPA allow for collection of
rainwater for analysis and submittal to EPA where pH ranges in the discharge may be more
acidic than allowed.
Response to Comment M10:
See Response to Comment L8, as the comment is substantially identical.
Comment M11:
Comment 10 – EPA should clarify that Global modified its permit renewal application.
Global submitted a modification to the NPDES permit renewal application to the EPA on
December 18, 2010.
It does not appear that the modification was addressed in the draft permit, as the draft permit fails
to refer to the modification documents. The modification to the outfall is described in VI.
Location and References for sampling points and flows, and includes the outfall reconfiguration
as exhibited in the line diagram attached to the EPA Form C. EPA should clarify the draft permit
to recognize and approve the modification.
Response to Comment M11:
EPA apologizes for the lack of clarity regarding its decision with respect to the permittee’s
modification of its permit renewal application. Requests were received by EPA detailing
proposed changes to the facility dated August 14, 2010, September 21, 2010, and December 18,
2010. EPA also requested further clarification from the permittee regarding the specific changes
75

in the discharge to Outfall 001 and the configuration of infrastructure, which the permittee
responded to on July 28, 2014.
As each request noted above varies slightly, in response to this comment, EPA has thoroughly
reviewed the “Supplement to the Permit Renewal Application MA0003298 – 12/15/10” dated
December 18, 2010 as specifically requested by the comment in reconsideration of the
permittee’s proposed changes. In this supplement and as clarified in subsequent correspondence,
the permittee requests approval to separate the two sources of stormwater which currently
discharge through Outfall 001 to alleviate flooding that occurs in the vicinity of the outfall. One
stormwater flow consists of stormwater from the pipeline corridor. The other consists of
stormwater from a portion of the former terminal yard currently leased to a commercial entity,
comprised primarily of a warehouse and paved parking area. The former will continue to be
treated through the existing oil/water separator and discharged through Outfall 001 to the
Chelsea River. The permittee has proposed that the latter be established as a separate and
independent flow through a second outfall that will not receive treatment through the oil/water
separator but will continue to be discharged through Outfall 001 to the Chelsea River.
EPA agrees to allow the permittee to separate these flows given the persistent problems with
flooding in this portion of the facility. However, based on the information provided to EPA in the
December 18, 2010 supplement and analytical data provided in duplicate on July 28, 2014, EPA
cannot exclude the separate outfall consisting of stormwater from the leased portion of the
former terminal yard from NPDES coverage, as explained below. Section 402(p) of the Clean
Water Act authorizes EPA to require a NPDES permit for stormwater discharges with respect to
which an NPDES permit has been issued before February 4, 1987. The NPDES permit for this
facility as issued to Union Petroleum Corporation effective May 26, 1978, authorized discharges
from this area via Outfall 001. Section 402(p) also authorizes EPA to require a NPDES permit
for stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity. Even if the former terminal yard is
“located on plant lands separate from the plant’s industrial activities,” the configuration proposed
by the permittee includes mixing stormwater runoff from this area with stormwater from an area
associated with industrial activity (i.e., the pipeline corridor), thereby bringing such a discharge
back under the regulatory definition of stormwater discharge associated with industrial activity.
40 C.F.R. §122.26(b)(14).
Therefore, EPA allows the proposed internal outfall for stormwater from the leased portion of
the former terminal yard. As this effluent comingles with stormwater treated through the
oil/water separator prior to discharge via Outfall 001, this stormwater is subject to the effluent
limitations and requirements for Outfall 001. Based on EPA’s review, this outfall cannot be
exempted from the effluent limitations and monitoring requirements for Outfall 001 as requested,
as the effluent will still be discharged to the Chelsea River via Outfall 001 and the characteristics
of this stormwater discharge per available data indicate that such a discharge contributes the
following pollutants:



pH measured at 5.7 standard units is outside of the range allowed under Massachusetts’
WQSs for Class SB waterbodies, 6.5 to 8.5 standard units.
Benzo(a)pyrene detected at 0.315 µg/L exceeds applicable National Recommended
Water Quality Criterion of 0.018 µg/L for human health, organism only. This criterion is
76



used for comparison because the Chelsea River is designated as a Class SB waterbody
that MassDEP has determined should support fishing. Because the Chelsea River is
impaired for petroleum hydrocarbons, a pollutant class that includes this compound,
discharge of this pollutant causes or has reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an
excursion above water quality criteria and must be limited.
Indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrene detected at 0.845 µg/L exceeds applicable National
Recommended Water Quality Criterion of 0.018 µg/L for human health, organism only.
This criterion is used for comparison because the Chelsea River is designated as a Class
SB waterbody that MassDEP has determined should support fishing. Because the Chelsea
River is impaired for petroleum hydrocarbons, a pollutant class that includes this
compound, discharge of this pollutant causes or has reasonable potential to cause or
contribute to an excursion above water quality criteria and must be limited. This
compound is limited at Outfall 001 via the indicator parameter for Group I Polycyclic
Aromatic Hydrocarbons, benzo(a)pyrene.

Based on this single sample, EPA cannot otherwise determine if permitting this discharge
without limitation ensures compliance with water quality standards. The sampling location for
Outfall 001 as specified in the draft permit as the discharge point to the Chelsea River, remains
unchanged. With regard to EPA’s authority for the inclusion of monitoring requirements, see
Response to Comment L2. EPA notes that this determination does not increase the sampling
requirements for the permittee and no flow rate limit has been included for the stormwater from
the leased portion of the former terminal yard.
Comment M12:
Comment 11 – The discharge limit for MTBE at Outfall 005 should remain unchanged from the
2005 permit.
The approach used by EPA to determine the MTBE discharge limit at Outfall 005 does not
justify the restrictive limit imposed in the draft permit. MTBE is not a listed priority pollutant
and the limit expressed in the draft permits is based on an advisory guidance of 20 to 40 µg/L. In
addition, the method used by EPA to determine if the discharge of MTBE would have a
reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC is based on a
recommended method of percentile measurements. In the absence of any data indicating that
MTBE is the cause of any current impaired status of Sales Creek, no MTBE limit is justifiable.
The MTBE discharge limit should remain unchanged from the 2005 permit and be set at 70
µg/L.
Response to Comment M12:
While the state has not identified MtBE as a pollutant causing impairment to a designated use in
the receiving water, EPA applies a standard of reasonableness to past effluent monitoring data
and the pollutants typical of petroleum products, which include additives and oxygenates. While
MtBE is no longer used at the facility, it persists in the effluent and/or groundwater at this and/or
the six additional terminals along the Chelsea River. As a result, and in consideration of
Massachusetts’ WQSs applicable to Sales Creek, EPA deemed MtBE a pollutant of concern.
77

Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality Standards for Class SA waters include a narrative
criterion for taste and odor that states, “[n]one other than natural origin”. 314 C.M.R.
§4.05(4)(a). Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality Standards also contain additional minimum
criteria applicable to all surface waters, including Class SA applicable to Sales Creek and Class
SB applicable to Chelsea River that state, “[a]ll surface waters shall be free from pollutants in
concentrations or combinations that are toxic to humans, aquatic life or wildlife”. 314 C.M.R.
§4.05(5)(e)
Under 33 U.S.C. §1251, in addition to basing numeric criteria on EPA's section 304(a) criteria
documents, States may also base numeric criteria on site-specific determinations or other
scientifically defensible methods through the state’s water quality standards or an
implementation policy or procedure. The commenter is correct that MtBE is not a priority
pollutant. However, it is a non-conventional pollutant under 33 U.S.C. §1314(a)(4), is a toxic
substance catalogued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,64 and has been
evaluated by EPA under the Safe Drinking Water Act.65 Criteria requirements applicable to
toxicants that are not priority toxic pollutants (e.g., ammonia and chlorine), are specified in the
Water Quality Standards Regulation (see 40 C.F.R. §131.11). Under these requirements, States
must adopt criteria based on sound scientific rationale that cover sufficient parameters to protect
designated uses. Both numeric and narrative criteria may be applied to meet these requirements.
EPA considers that the narrative criteria apply to all designated uses and are necessary to meet
the statutory requirements of section 303(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Water Act .66
Massachusetts’ Implementation Policy for the Control of Toxic Pollutants in Surface Waters,
February 23, 1990, outlines MassDEP’s policy in implementing the narrative criteria applicable
to toxics, including, but not limited to, priority pollutants under Section 307(a) of the Clean
Water Act and interpreted for regulatory purposes in EPA’s “Gold Book”.67 The stated goals are
to: 1) protect public health, encompassing uses as public drinking water supply, primary contact
recreation and secondary contact recreation, further subdivided into four major exposure routes drinking water ingestion, dermal contact, inhalation; and fish ingestion; 2) protect aquatic life
and wildlife, both short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic); and 3) prevent the accumulation of
toxic pollutants, in sediment and/or biota, including the edibility of fish and shellfish. The
narrative states that where a toxic pollutant is of concern, and no criterion is specified in the
regulation, then a recommended limit, defined as a proposed criterion from an authoritative
source such as EPA’s “Gold Book”, drinking water regulations, and U.S. Food and Drug
Administration’s Action Levels for fish and shellfish. The policy further states that
recommended limits function exactly like criteria except that they are listed and documented by
these other authoritative sources and are thusly incorporated by reference. Since Massachusetts
has not promulgated a numeric criterion for the applicable narrative criteria with regard to MtBE,
EPA followed the requirements of 40 C.F.R. §122.44 (e.g., 40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)(1)(vi)), and 40
Toxicological Profile for Methyl tert-Butyl Ether (MTBE), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry

C.F.R. §131, namely 40 C.F.R. §131.11(a)(2), via Massachusetts’ Implementation Policy for the
Control of Toxic Pollutants in Surface Waters, in determining an appropriate recommended
limit.
Massachusetts’ WQSs further contain criteria specific to the aesthetics designated use, namely
that, “All surface waters shall be free from pollutants in concentrations or combinations that
settle to form objectionable deposits; float as debris, scum or other matter to form nuisances;
produce objectionable odor, color, taste or turbidity; or produce undesirable or nuisance species
of aquatic life.” 314 C.M.R. §4.05(5)(a). Based on the applicable narrative criteria, and the
documented threshold value for taste and odor effects as a lifetime health advisory for MtBE in
connection with the Safe Drinking Water Act, the criterion selected was 40 µg/L for taste effects
and 20 µg/l for odor effects. The use of the advisory threshold value for MtBE is an
interpretation of the narrative standard at 314 C.M.R. §4.05(5)(e) and further satisfies 314
C.M.R. §4.05(4)(a) and 314 C.M.R. §4.05(5)(a), based on sound scientific rationale and
pollutant-specific documentation noted above. Thus, the criterion to which EPA compared
projected effluent concentrations in determining reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an
excursion above water quality standards is appropriate.
Further, EPA disagrees that an MtBE limit is only justifiable where the data indicates that MtBE
is the cause of an excursion above water quality criteria applicable for Sales Creek. The
applicable legal standard looks not only to whether discharges cause, but also whether those
discharges have a reasonable potential to cause or contribute to a violation of water quality
standards.68 To determine if the concentrations discharged by the facility cause or have a
reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above the Massachusetts’ narrative
WQC, EPA followed the guidance in Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based
Toxics Control. While the commenter notes this methodology as “recommended”, no acceptable
alternative acceptable method for analysis is suggested. Based on the lognormal distribution of
effluent data and the quantity of available data, the percentile approach prescribed in EPA’s
Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control to determine reasonable
potential is appropriate. As the reasonable potential analysis included in the permit’s fact sheet
demonstrated, the discharge has reasonable potential to cause an excursion above the odor
threshold value for MtBE.
Finally, the limitation the commenter has requested to maintain is a TBEL. Where a WQBEL is
more stringent than a TBEL, EPA must include the more stringent WQBEL in the NPDES
permit. Therefore, EPA retains the WQBEL in the final permit, 20 µg/L for MtBE.

79

Global appreciates the enormous effort that EPA devoted to preparing the draft permit, and finds
that much of the content is reasonable and appropriate. Global believes, however, that certain
provisions are inapt particularly in considering presently available information regarding the
terminal.
In the balance of this letter, Global identifies the modifications it believes appropriate, and
explains the bases for each.
Response to Comment N1:
EPA notes the comment.
Comment N2:
Comment 1 – The proposed discharge limits and sample parameters must be related to the
discharge reasonably expected from a facility.
EPA must have a rational basis for determining a facility’s discharge limits and sampling
parameters. EPA improperly relies upon Section 308 of the Clean Water Act to provide authority
to require reporting of information necessary to establish appropriate discharge limits. EPA,
through reporting requirements, seeks to determine if discharge limitations are necessary in the
future. However, the basis for establishing reporting requirements should be to limit and treat the
constituents known to exist in the groundwater, soil and other surficial areas at a facility or the
discharge from that facility that may impact the receiving waterbody. The sampling parameters
and frequency should not encompass potential substances that have no connection to the
discharge, have not been detected at a facility, are not in use at or in processes at a facility, or
which are not under the control of a permitted operator. The following changes should be made
to the final permits.
A. Monitoring for chromium, iron, cyanide, phenol, ammonia and fecal coliform should
be deleted.
 Chromium, cyanide and phenols are generally emitted by coating or plating
processes. Global is unaware of any historic process at the terminal that used
these constituents, or of any sample data that suggests these constituents are
present in the stormwater discharge from the terminal. As these substances are not
actually present at the terminal and are not used or stored at the terminal, there is
no basis to require testing for them.
 Global is unaware of any past process activities that released iron at the terminal.
As noted by EPA in the facts sheets, iron occurs naturally in the soils in the area.
As there is no evidence that iron impacts the stormwater discharge above
expected background levels, there is no basis to require testing for iron.
 Fecal coliform testing should not be required as there are no sanitary discharges to
any of the outfalls at the Global terminal. While the Chelsea River is impaired for
its designated uses, and fecal coliform is a pollutant requiring a TMDL, there is
no evidence to suggest that the terminal is or has been a source.

80



Should EPA elect to not adopt Global’s above approach, Global proposes in the
alternative that the sampling for these constituents be conducted in the first year,
but for each constituent that is not detected above background levels, nothing
thereafter.

B. If, following the first required WET Test, it is shown that the discharge from the
terminal has the same or greater survivability of the target species than that of the
Receiving Water (Chelsea Creek), the proposed annual testing should be changed to
require testing only every three years.
C. The frequency of any monthly sample parameter reported by the analyzing laboratory
as not detected in a given discharge over a twelve (12) month sampling period should
be automatically amended to require only quarterly sampling.
Response to Comment N2:
See Response to Comment L2, as the comment is substantially identical. EPA notes that
monitoring for cyanide were not included in the draft permit for this facility as this pollutant was
not identified as a pollutant of concern inasmuch as the facility has a different operational history
from that of the Chelsea Sandwich Terminal and the Sunoco Logistics Terminal. With regard to
iron, the permittee reported in its permit renewal application a concentration of 128 µg/L at
Outfall 001 and 216 µg/L at Outfall 002. With regard to ammonia, the permittee reported in its
permit renewal application a concentration of 3.36 mg/L at Outfall 001 and 0.840 mg/L at
Outfall 002. The supporting rationale for these pollutants of concern does not differ from the
basis described in Response to Comment L2 and the permits’ fact sheets.
EPA also notes that tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) was identified as a pollutant of concern for this
facility which is not described in Response to Comment L2. With regard to TBA, see Response
to Comment M4.
Comment N3:
Comment 2 – The installation of flow meters should not be required.
EPA should amend the draft permit to continue use of the current method of determining flow
rate rather than requiring installation of flow meters at the outfall. Stormwater discharge
metering is unnecessary as the terminal impounds all stormwater before pumping to an oil/water
separator (“OWS”) prior to discharge. EPA’s intent in requiring metering, as discussed in the
fact sheets, is to ensure that flow into the OWS does not exceed the design flow capacity of the
OWS, thus rendering it ineffective. Because the rate of influent to the OWS is always controlled
by pump rates, the throughput capacity cannot be exceeded.
Global currently determines flow to the terminal’s OWS by recording the hours of operation of
each discharge pump associated with the terminal’s OWS. The total discharge flow rate is then
calculated as the product of pump maximum discharge rate (capacity) and its operating time in
hours. This method likely overestimates the total flow rate to the OWS, keeping the actual flow
81

in compliance with permit discharge limits. It also ensures that the flow rate into the OWS does
not exceed the design capacity. As the terminal flows have not exceeded the design capacity of
the OWS at any facility, installation of the flow meters is not necessary.
At the Global terminal, Global has installed restrictions that further limit the flow into the OWS.
This further prevents the possibility that the pump rate into the OWS will exceed the design
capacity of the OWS.
In addition, Global notes that addition of a totalizer, which would measure the total output of a
certain discharge over a period of time (for instance, a month), would not provide any safeguard
against an exceedance of the design capacity of the OWS. In contrast to calculating the pump
rate into the OWS and the restrictions on flow discussed above, a totalizer would just provide the
total flow volume that was discharged.
Finally, Global has concerns that installing totalizers on the flow would be ineffective due to
blockages, freezing or calibration issues. Such mechanical issues will not provide the required
assurances that OWS design capacity has not been exceeded.
EPA should amend the draft permit and allow the flow rate to be calculated in the same manner
as the 2005 permit. Global will continue to maintain records regarding flow rates, and will notify
EPA of any modification to the impoundment system that would result in changes to the
discharge to the OWS. This method will continue to allow for proper operation of the OWS and
keep flow into the OWS below design limitations.
Response to Comment N3:
See Response to Comment L3, as the comment is substantially identical. The permit requirement
to use a flow meter was incorporated to allow for collection of actual volume information. This
information is critical to evaluation of pollutant loading from the facility to the receiving water to
ensure that the discharges do not cause or contribute to an excursion above water quality
standards.
Comment N4:
Comment 3 – EPA should clarify the bases for reopening a permit.
The final permit should provide for notice and comment by the permit holder prior to EPA
reopening a final permit. The draft permits each contain a reopener clause that allows
modification to the permits at any time pursuant to 40 C.F.R. §122.62. Section 122.62 provides
wide-ranging authority to reopen a permit for modification, including among other things
substantial alteration to a facility, new information regarding operations, promulgation of new
standards or regulations, judicial decision and detection of non-limited pollutants above levels
that can be achieved by appropriate technology-based treatment methods. A modification can be
either minor, which does not require a new draft permit or public comment period upon the
consent of the permittee, or require the more burdensome issuance of a new draft permit if the

82

modification does not qualify as minor under 40 C.F.R. §122.63. Section 122.62 also allows
reopening in limited circumstances, such as noncompliance, for revocation or reissuance.
As Section 122.62 provides wide discretion for EPA to reopen the permits for a wide variety of
reasons, the final permit should contain a provision that EPA will notify a permit holder prior to
reopening a permit, allowing for discussion and comments on the rationale for reopening, the
nature of proposed revisions and the potential to resolve a proposed revision as a minor
modification, prior to a decision to issue a draft permit or open the matter to the public.
Response to Comment N4:
See Response to Comment L4, as the comment is substantially identical.
Comment N5:
Comment 4 – EPA should provide a concise definition of PQL.
EPA should define PQL as it is used in the draft permits. For example, during the April 17, 2014
informational meeting and public hearing on the draft permits, EPA stated the proposed
benzo(a)pyrene compliance limit is the detection limit and not the number (0.018 µg/L) which is
provided in the Effluent Limitation and Monitoring Requirements.
Global has concerns regarding certifying discharge monitoring reports as being compliant when
the required laboratory analyses cannot meet the Effluent Limitation. The reporting of an amount
above the actual discharge limitation, but below the laboratory’s detection limit, will result in
confusion, potential issues with NetDMR and the potential for a discharge to be found out of
compliance.
As the proposed Limitation and Monitoring Requirement is in some instances below the
detection limit, EPA should adopt the present method detection limits as the effluent limits. EPA
can then amend the discharge limit as sample technology improves, thus lowering the detection
limits.
Response to Comment N5:
See Response to Comment L5, as the comment is substantially identical.
Comment N6:
Comment 5 – EPA should relieve permit holders from accounting for background chemicals in
pretreated City water.
Global uses water directly from the City of Revere for hydrostatic testing at the terminal.
Because this water is pretreated to state drinking water standards, Global requests that the final
permits relieve Global from any requirements to account for background chemical
concentrations detected in the incoming water.
83

Comment N7:
Comment 6 – EPA should exempt treated surface or groundwater from the requirements of
Section 1.B.
EPA should exempt treated surface or groundwater from the requirements of Section 1.B of the
draft permits when, after a treatment with “activated carbon absorption” or similar method, the
water meets the discharge limitations and criteria of the permits.
Response to Comment N7:
See Response to Comment L7, as the comment is substantially identical.
Comment N8:
Comment 7 – The final permits should acknowledge that naturally-occurring rainwater in New
England exceeds EPA’s proposed discharge limitations and allow for submittal of data should a
discharge exceed the pH discharge limits.
While the discharge from the terminal has historically met the discharge limits for pH, Global is
concerned about the more stringent discharge limits for pH in the draft permits. National
Atmospheric Deposition Program (“NADP”) data shows that rainwater in the New England
region often has a pH below the proposed discharge limitation of 6.5-8.5 S.U. (see attached
Exhibit A). Based on the NADP data, it appears that rainwater in New England contains pH
levels below 6.0 S.U.
As the Global terminal is a petroleum storage and distribution facility, there are no processes that
alter pH. It appears that some level of natural buffering occurs, resulting in pH in stormwater
above 6.0 S.U., due to contact with soils and impermeable surfaces at the terminals. However, as
this natural buffering is limited and outside the control of Global, EPA should acknowledge that
the pH of rainwater in this area is acidic, and that this is a natural condition that impacts the
stormwater discharge.
The draft permit should be modified to include that a discharge below 6.5 S.U. or evidence that
the receiving waterbody’s pH level fluctuated more than 0.2 S.U. during a storm event do not
constitute a violation of the permits. Further, Global suggests that EPA allow for collection of
rainwater for analysis and submittal to EPA where pH ranges in the discharge may be more
acidic than allowed.
Response to Comment N8:

84

See Response to Comment L8, as the comment is substantially identical.
Comment N9:
Comment 8 – The sampling location for Outfall 001 should be moved to a safer, more
accessible location.
The draft permit includes the new requirement for sampling at Outfall 001. As the existing
Outfall 001 extends into the tidal waters, at times during the high tide, the outfall is submerged
and the location is potentially unsafe for the sample collector. Thus, Global proposes an
alternate, safer sampling location at the point adjacent to the discharge point from the OWS.
Water samples obtained at this location will be representative of the discharge at Outfall 001 and
will meet the location criteria for such sampling.
Response to Comment N9:
EPA agrees that the proposed sampling location will yield samples representative of the
discharge from Outfall 001. However, the draft permit did not require that the permittee sample
at the discharge point to the Chelsea River for Outfall 001. Rather, the draft permit required that
“samples for Outfall 001 shall be collected after effluents from internal Outfalls 002 and 003
comingle in the concrete vault adjacent to the Terminal’s primary oil/water separator (OWS),
free from tidal influence.” EPA believes this sampling location is consistent with the permittee’s
request. Therefore, there is no change in sampling location between the draft and final permits.
EPA also notes that the permittee may change the sampling location during the permit term, if
necessary, provided the change is approved in writing by EPA and MassDEP.
Comment N10:
Comment 9 – EPA should authorize treatment and discharge of contaminated commingled
stormwater as well as groundwater.
Page 12 of the draft permit states that Global “is authorized to discharge treated groundwater
through internal waste stream.” This allows discharge of groundwater through the outfall
following remedial treatment. Global requests that this be clarified and amended to also allow for
treatment of contaminated commingled stormwater as well as groundwater resulting from
infiltration and inflow of the groundwater into the stormwater collection system, when and if
necessary.
Response to Comment N10:
EPA agrees to allow the discharge of groundwater and contaminated stormwater following
treatment through the remediation system. EPA has changed the final permit to reflect this
allowance. Application of additional treatment to contaminated stormwater is expected to
improve the overall quality of effluent discharged from the facility. Any effluent discharged
through Outfall 003 is subject to the effluent limitations and monitoring requirements of Part
I.A.3. of the final permit.
85

Comment N11:
Comment 10 – The discharge limit for MTBE should remain unchanged from the 2005 permit.
The approach used by EPA to determine the MTBE discharge limit at Outfall 001 does not
justify the restrictive limit imposed in the draft permit. MTBE is not a listed priority pollutant
and the limit expressed in the draft permits is based on an advisory guidance of 20 to 40 µg/L. In
addition, the method used by EPA to determine if the discharge of MTBE would have a
reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above WQC is based on a
recommended method of percentile measurements. In the absence of any data indicating that
MTBE is the cause of any current impaired status of the Chelsea River, no MTBE limit is
justifiable. The MTBE discharge limit should remain unchanged from the 2005 permit at 70
µg/L.
Response to Comment N11:
See Response to Comment M12, as the comment is substantially identical. With respect to the
Chelsea River specifically, EPA further notes that this waterbody is impaired for the Aquatic
Life, Aesthetics, Primary Contact and Secondary Contact Uses as a result of petroleum and the
pollutants ”petroleum hydrocarbons” and “odor”, among others. MassDEP has not determined
which individual compounds cause or contribute to the impairments. As a result, EPA considered
the compounds that are more likely to be present in the effluent based on monitoring data for the
Terminal and similar facilities, and information documented in Section 7 of EPA’s Technical
Support Document for the 2004 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan69 including petroleum bulk
stations and terminals (Section 7.12), which have known organoleptic effects (i.e., taste and
odor). Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality Standards for Class SB waters include a narrative
criterion for taste and odor that states, “[n]one in such concentrations or combinations that are
aesthetically objectionable, that would impair any use assigned to this class, or that would cause
tainting or undesirable flavors in the edible portions of aquatic life”. 314 C.M.R. §4.05(4)(b)8.
As described in the permit’s fact sheet, groundwater samples at the facility have indicated up to
10,000 μg/L of MtBE. From January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013, concentrations ranged
from below the PQL to 34.2 µg/L at Outfall 002 and from below the PQL to 81.4 µg/L at Outfall
003. As the reasonable potential analysis describes, effluent concentrations have reasonable
potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above applicable water quality criteria. In
addition, in February 2014, the facility reported an MtBE concentration of 2,170 µg/L at Outfall
002 and in April 2014, the facility reported an MtBE concentration of 81.4 µg/L at Outfall 003.
These data indicate elevated levels of MtBE persist. For these and the additional reasons detailed
in Response to Comment M12, EPA retains the WQBEL in the final permit, 20 µg/L for MtBE.

future. However, the basis for establishing reporting requirements should be to limit and treat the
constituents known to exist in the groundwater, soil and other surficial areas at a facility or the
discharge from that facility that may impact the receiving waterbody. The sampling parameters
and frequency should not encompass potential substances that have no connection to the
discharge, have not been detected at a facility, are not in use at or in processes at a facility, or
which are not under the control of a permitted operator. The following changes should be made
to the final permits.
A. Monitoring for chromium, iron, cyanide, phenol, ammonia and fecal coliform should
be deleted.
 Chromium, cyanide and phenols are generally emitted by coating or plating
processes. Global is unaware of any historic process at the terminal that used
these constituents, or of any sample data that suggests these constituents are
present in the stormwater discharge from the terminal. As these substances are
not actually present at the terminal and are not used or stored at the terminal, there
is no basis to require testing for them.
 Global is unaware of any past process activities that released iron at the terminal.
As noted by EPA in the facts sheets, iron occurs naturally in the soils in the area.
As there is no evidence that iron impacts the stormwater discharge above
expected background levels, there is no basis to require testing for iron.
87





Fecal coliform testing should not be required as there are no sanitary discharges to
the outfall at the Global terminal. While the Chelsea River is impaired for its
designated uses, and fecal coliform is a pollutant requiring a TMDL, there is no
evidence to suggest that the terminal is or has been a source.
Should EPA elect to not adopt Global’s above approach, Global proposes in the
alternative that the sampling for these constituents be conducted in the first year,
but for each constituent that is not detected above background levels, nothing
thereafter.

B. If, following the first required WET Test, it is shown that the discharge from the
terminal has the same or greater survivability of the target species than that of the
Receiving Water (Chelsea Creek), the proposed annual testing should be changed to
require testing only every three years.
C. The frequency of any monthly sample parameter reported by the analyzing laboratory
as not detected in a given discharge over a twelve (12) month sampling period should
be automatically amended to require only quarterly sampling.
Response to Comment O2:
See Response to Comment L2, as the comment is substantially identical. EPA notes that
monitoring for cyanide was not included in the draft permit for this facility as this pollutant was
not identified as a pollutant of concern inasmuch as the facility has a different operational history
from that of the Chelsea Sandwich Terminal and Sunoco Logistics Terminal. In addition, while
verifying the parameters included in the pollutant scan based on review of the permittee’s permit
renewal application, EPA identified the omission of certain monitoring requirements.
Specifically, EPA notes that iron was detected at 1,900 µg/L at Outfall 001, as reported in the
permittee’s permit renewal application. This concentration exceeds the applicable criteria
described in Response to Comment M4. As also discussed in Response to Comment M4, where
the available data for iron indicate concentrations may cause, or have reasonable potential to
cause, or contribute to an excursion above applicable water quality criteria, but monitoring data
is limited, monitoring, without limits is necessary to ensure discharges meet Massachusetts’
water quality standards. However, EPA inadvertently omitted this requirement from the draft
permit. Therefore, the final permit includes monitoring, without limits for total recoverable iron
under the effluent pollutant scan. With regard to chromium, the permittee reported in its permit
renewal application a concentration of 2.0 µg/L at Outfall 001. With regard to ammonia, the
permittee reported in its permit renewal application a concentration of 0.630 mg/L at Outfall 001.
The supporting rationale for these pollutants of concern does not differ from the basis described
in Response to Comment L2 and the permits’ fact sheets.
EPA also notes that tert-butyl alcohol (“TBA”) was identified as a pollutant of concern for this
permit which is not described in Response to Comment L2. With regard to TBA, see Response to
Comment M4.
Comment O3:
88

Comment 2 – The installation of flow meters should not be required.
EPA should amend the draft permit to continue use of the current method of determining flow
rate rather than requiring installation of flow meters at the outfall. Stormwater discharge
metering is unnecessary as the terminal impounds all stormwater before pumping to an oil/water
separator (“OWS”) prior to discharge. EPA’s intent in requiring metering, as discussed in the
fact sheets, is to ensure that flow into the OWS does not exceed the design flow capacity of the
OWS, thus rendering it ineffective. Because the rate of influent to the OWS is always controlled
by pump rates, the throughput capacity cannot be exceeded.
Global currently determines flow to the terminal’s OWS by recording the hours of operation of
each discharge pump associated with the terminal’s OWS. The total discharge flow rate is then
calculated as the product of pump maximum discharge rate (capacity) and its operating time in
hours. This method likely overestimates the total flow rate to the OWS, keeping the actual flow
in compliance with permit discharge limits. It also ensures that the flow rate into the OWS does
not exceed the design capacity. As the terminal flows have not exceeded the design capacity of
the OWS at any facility, installation of the flow meters is not necessary.
In addition, Global notes that addition of a totalizer, which would measure the total output of a
certain discharge over a period of time (for instance, a month), would not provide any safeguard
against an exceedance of the design capacity of the OWS. In contrast to calculating the pump
rate into the OWS, a totalizer would just provide the total flow volume that was discharged.
Finally, Global has concerns that installing totalizers on the flow would be ineffective due to
blockages, freezing or calibration issues. Such mechanical issues will not provide the required
assurances that OWS design capacity has not been exceeded.
EPA should amend the draft permit and allow the flow rate to be calculated in the same manner
as the 2005 permit. Global will continue to maintain records regarding flow rates, and will notify
EPA of any modification to the impoundment system that would result in changes to the
discharge to the OWS. This method will continue to allow for proper operation of the OWS and
keep flow into the OWS below design limitations.
Response to Comment O3:
See Response to Comment L3, as the comment is substantially identical. The permit requirement
to use a flow meter was incorporated to allow for collection of actual volume information. This
information is critical to evaluation of pollutant loading from the facility to the receiving water to
ensure that the discharges do not cause or contribute to an excursion above water quality
standards.
Comment O4:
Comment 3 – EPA should clarify the bases for reopening a permit.

89

The final permit should provide for notice and comment by the permit holder prior to EPA
reopening a final permit. The draft permits each contain a reopener clause that allows
modification to the permits at any time pursuant to 40 C.F.R. §122.62. Section 122.62 provides
wide-ranging authority to reopen a permit for modification, including among other things
substantial alteration to a facility, new information regarding operations, promulgation of new
standards or regulations, judicial decision and detection of non-limited pollutants above levels
that can be achieved by appropriate technology-based treatment methods. A modification can be
either minor, which does not require a new draft permit or public comment period upon the
consent of the permittee, or require the more burdensome issuance of a new draft permit if the
modification does not qualify as minor under 40 C.F.R. §122.63. Section 122.62 also allows
reopening in limited circumstances, such as noncompliance, for revocation or reissuance.
As Section 122.62 provides wide discretion for EPA to reopen the permits for a wide variety of
reasons, the final permit should contain a provision that EPA will notify a permit holder prior to
reopening a permit, allowing for discussion and comments on the rationale for reopening, the
nature of proposed revisions and the potential to resolve a proposed revision as a minor
modification, prior to a decision to issue a draft permit or open the matter to the public.
Response to Comment O4:
See Response to Comment L4, as the comment is substantially identical.
Comment O5:
Comment 4 – EPA should provide a concise definition of PQL.
EPA should define PQL as it is used in the draft permits. For example, during the April 17, 2014
informational meeting and public hearing on the draft permits, EPA stated the proposed
benzo(a)pyrene compliance limit is the detection limit and not the number (0.018 µg/L) which is
provided in the Effluent Limitation and Monitoring Requirements.
Global has concerns regarding certifying discharge monitoring reports as being compliant when
the required laboratory analyses cannot meet the Effluent Limitation. The reporting of an amount
above the actual discharge limitation, but below the laboratory’s detection limit, will result in
confusion, potential issues with NetDMR and the potential for a discharge to be found out of
compliance.
As the proposed Limitation and Monitoring Requirement is in some instances below the
detection limit, EPA should adopt the present laboratory detection limits as the effluent limits.
EPA can then amend the discharge limit as sample technology improves, thus lowering the
detection limits.

Comment O6:
Comment 5 – EPA should relieve permit holders from accounting for background chemicals in
pretreated City water.
Global uses water directly from the City of Revere for hydrostatic testing at the terminal.
Because this water is pretreated to state drinking water standards, Global requests that the final
permits relieve Global from any requirements to account for background chemical
concentrations detected in the incoming water.

Comment O7:
Comment 6 – EPA should exempt treated surface or groundwater from the requirements of
Section 1.B.
EPA should exempt treated surface or groundwater from the requirements of Section 1.B of the
draft permits when, after a treatment with “activated carbon absorption” or similar method, the
water meets the discharge limitations and criteria of the permits.
Response to Comment O7:
See Response to Comment L7, as the comment is substantially identical.
Comment O8:
Comment 7 – The final permits should acknowledge that naturally-occurring rainwater in New
England exceeds EPA’s proposed discharge limitations and allow for submittal of data should a
discharge exceed the pH discharge limits.
While the discharge from the terminal has historically met the discharge limits for pH, Global is
concerned about the more stringent discharge limits for pH in the draft permits. National
Atmospheric Deposition Program (“NADP”) data shows that rainwater in the New England
region often has a pH below the proposed discharge limitation of 6.5-8.5 S.U. (see attached
Exhibit A). Based on the NADP data, it appears that rainwater in New England contains pH
levels below 6.0 S.U.
As the Global terminals are petroleum storage and distribution facilities, there are no processes
that alter pH. It appears that some level of natural buffering occurs, resulting in pH in stormwater
above 6.0 S.U., due to contact with soils and impermeable surfaces at the terminals. However, as
this natural buffering is limited and outside the control of Global, EPA should acknowledge that
the pH of rainwater in this area is acidic, and that this is a natural condition that impacts the
stormwater discharge.
91

The draft permits should be modified to include that a discharge below 6.5 S.U. or evidence that
the receiving waterbody’s pH level fluctuated more than 0.2 S.U. during a storm event do not
constitute a violation of the permits. Further, Global suggests that EPA allow for collection of
rainwater for analysis and submittal to EPA where pH ranges in the discharge may be more
acidic than allowed.

Limited Partnership:
Comment P1:
Comment 1: Part I.A.1, Table – Frequency of Monitoring for VOCs and SVOCs
The table in Part I.A.1 of the draft permit lists the effluent monitoring requirements and includes
monthly monitoring for benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, and naphthalene. As shown in Attachment 3 of
the Fact Sheet for the Draft Permit (monitoring data from 2009 through 2013), during five years
of quarterly effluent sampling (19 events; one month was ‘no discharge’), benzene,
benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene were each only detected once at concentrations that did not
exceed the proposed discharge limits in the draft permit. This is a 95% non-detect rate for each
parameter.
Therefore, based on these results from the past 5 years, we maintain that quarterly sampling for
benzene, benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene provides sufficient characterization of the effluent
from the site and is protective of Chelsea River. We request that the monitoring frequency for
benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, and naphthalene be changed from monthly to quarterly in the final
permit. In lieu of that, we ask for the opportunity to demonstrate that quarterly sampling is
sufficient, by proposing monthly sampling for benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, and naphthalene be
required for the first year of the permit, after which, if there is no more than one detection of
each of these parameters during that time, then the monitoring frequency will be reduced to
quarterly.
Response to Comment P1:
See Response to Comment B3, C2, and L2 regarding the monitoring frequencies included in the
final permit and the allowances for reductions in monitoring frequencies.
EPA disagrees that the previous five years of monitoring for benzene and monitoring, without
limits, for benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene, included to inform future permit conditions and
compliance, have been sufficient to cease or reduce monitoring for these parameters. The
92

quarterly monitoring frequency required for these parameters in the existing permit was not
established to specifically address a pollutant causing impairment to the designated uses in the
Chelsea River, for which the facility is identified as a source. Rather, the limited monitoring was
designed to screen for pollutants with human health concerns with the potential to be present at
the facility. When the permit’s previous monitoring program was established, data specific to
petroleum hydrocarbons relative to impairments in the Chelsea River were absent. In the reissued
permit, benzene, and similarly, benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene, were selected as indicator
parameters for the much larger class of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds. EPA does
not believe quarterly monitoring is sufficient to meet the purpose of utilizing such indicators. As
described in Response to Comment L2, effluent variability, and therefore the standard deviation
and coefficient of variation, are significant statistical factors that EPA uses to ensure an effluent
limitation is sufficient to meet water quality standards. These indices of variability are better
quantified through monthly monitoring rather than quarterly monitoring.
Furthermore, EPA disagrees that quarterly monitoring is protective of the Chelsea River. EPA’s
Interim Guidance for Performance Based Reductions of NPDES Permit Monitoring Frequencies
does not recommend reducing the monitoring frequency for pollutants with significant
environmental or human health concerns. As benzene, benzo(a)pyrene and naphthalene are
known, probable and/or possible carcinogens with additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects,
EPA maintains that increased monitoring frequencies are necessary to protect human health and
the environment. Further, the criterion from which the limitation for benzo(a)pyrene was
derived, is less than the currently achievable level at which the compound can be detected.
EPA’s Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control recommends more
monitoring requirements and permit conditions where it cannot be definitively demonstrated that
a limited parameter, while not detected, is not causing or contributing to an excursion above
water quality criteria.70
Finally, EPA disagrees that quarterly monitoring provides sufficient characterization of the
effluent. With regard to the critical importance of data quality improvements expected from
increased monitoring, see Response to Comment B3. To fully characterize the actual pollutant
concentrations in the effluent, monitoring would need to be conducted continuously. This
approach is neither practical not reasonable given the intermittent nature of discharges, the cost
of analytical testing organic pollutants and the level of confidence that can be achieved through
an appropriately designed monitoring program. EPA believes the monitoring frequencies
established in the permit will allow for characterization of the overall water quality of the
effluent, minimize the risk of undetected violations, and are appropriate given the increased
sensitivity of the receiving water to pollutants of environmental and human health significance.
EPA typically evaluates factors beyond compliance with a limit to justify monitoring reductions,
including the ratio of measured concentrations to permitted levels, an acceptable coefficient of
variation and the importance of a limited parameter (i.e., that a parameter is an indicator of
overall compliance rather than a pollutant that is under independent control). Further, EPA
cannot determine the ratio of effluent concentrations to limitations71 for any parameter for which
monitoring data are insufficient. As an example, where a parameter limited is 15 mg/L, the
parameter is monitored monthly, and the long term average over a three year return interval is
70
71

See Chapter 5; EPA/505/2-90-001, March, 1991.
Method described in EPA 833-B-96-001, April 1996.

93

5 mg/L, then the ratio of the long term average to the limit is 33%, a ratio eligible for a possible
reduction to quarterly monitoring.
In sum, the increases in monitoring frequencies for limited indicator parameters were determined
on a case-by-case basis as being necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of the
Clean Water Act and ensure compliance with Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality Standards.
However, EPA agrees that reductions in monitoring frequencies may be acceptable for certain
parameters following the collection of representative data and the documentation of consistent
compliance with permit limitations. Therefore, the final permit specifies that no reduction in
monitoring frequency will occur within the first three years following the effective date of the
final permit. After this three year period, should monitoring data for the specified parameters
support a reduction in monitoring frequency, the Permittee may request such a reduction for
those parameters. Rationale supporting such a request must evaluate the representativeness of the
monitoring data, permit compliance and any other factors such as facility changes, treatment
system optimization, source control or reduction achievements, voluntary coordination of sample
timing, additional ambient sampling, community outreach, and other factors that the Permittee
believes EPA should consider when the request is evaluated.
Comment P2:
Comment 2: Monitoring for MTBE
The table in Part I.A.1 of the draft permit includes quarterly monitoring for methyl tert-butyl
ether (MTBE). MTBE has not been used or stored at the facility since 2007. The quarterly
monitoring results from 2009 through 2014, as provided in Attachment 3 of the Fact Sheet for
the Draft Permit, show that MTBE has not been detected in the Terminal’s effluent for the past 5
years. The Fact Sheet for the draft permit states that “the permit renewal application submitted
by the Permittee indicates the average MTBE concentration in 16 samples was 40 μg/L and the
maximum concentration was 520 μg/L”. The data referred to in this statement is from 2005 to
2009, and in fact the last detection of MTBE in the Terminal’s effluent was in June 2007 (11
µg/L; the proposed discharge limit is 20 µg/L). A copy of the relevant page of Table 2 from the
permit renewal application is attached. The Fact Sheet also mentioned detections of MTBE in
groundwater as a potential source to the stormwater system. While there have been detections of
MTBE in groundwater at the site, the effluent data for the past seven years shows that it is not
entering the stormwater collection system.
Therefore, we maintain that ongoing monitoring for MTBE under the new permit is unnecessary
and does not provide additional protection of Chelsea River. We request that monitoring for
MTBE be removed in the final permit.
Response to Comment P2:
EPA notes the clarification on concentrations of MtBE measured in effluent from the facility.
Based on this information, MtBE has not been discharged at concentrations that cause or have
the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above the applicable water quality

94

criterion for more than five years. As such, a limit is not required. The effluent limitation of 20
µg/L for MtBE has been removed from the final permit.
However, given the persistence of MtBE in groundwater at the site as noted, and pending the
implementation of the stormwater system BMP, which is intended to confirm no pathways exist
for groundwater contamination to enter the stormwater conveyance system, monitoring for MtBE
is continued in the final permit. Since MtBE persists in groundwater, EPA believes MtBE is an
appropriate indicator parameter of infiltration of contaminated groundwater in the years after
MtBE was used in petroleum products stored at the facility. MtBE should not be present in the
effluent unless migration pathways between groundwater and stormwater exist. Should the
implementation of the stormwater system BMP demonstrate stormwater system integrity and
MtBE is not detected in the effluent, monitoring for MtBE may be discontinued as specified in
the final permit.
Also see Response to Comment M12 and Response to Comment N11.
Comment P3:
Comment 3: Installation of Totalizer or Similar Device
Footnote 4 of the table in Part I.A.1 of the draft permit requires the measuring of flow during
discharge using a totalizer or similar device. Currently the Terminal does not have such device
and estimates the flow volume. Installation of such a device on the final effluent pipe will require
a considerable level of effort to arrange construction activities such that they do not interfere
with operation of the stormwater collection system. Therefore, we request that the final permit
specify that the Terminal has 180 days after the effective date of the permit to install the totalizer
or similar device for measuring final discharge flow.
Response to Comment P3:
EPA agrees that sufficient time is necessary to install the required device such that it does not
interfere with the current level of treatment and control of discharges from the facility.
Therefore, the final permit includes the requested six month time period for installation of the
required flow meter and allows the current method of estimating flow in the interim. Also see
Response to Comment L3.
Comment P4:
Comment 4: Annual Sampling for Pollutant Scan and Wet Testing
The draft permit calls for annual sampling of the Terminal effluent and receiving water for a
pollutant scan and for whole effluent toxicity testing (WET testing). Sampling of the receiving
water is unlikely to provide useful information on the impact of the Terminal’s discharge on the
water quality of Chelsea River.

95

First, the draft permit is unclear as to whether the receiving water samples are to be collected
from upstream or downstream of the outfall’s zone of influence. Footnotes 13 and 16 to the table
in Part I.A.1 state that the samples are to be “collected from the Chelsea River at a point
immediately outside of Outfall 003’s zone of influence at a reasonably accessible location”. The
Marine Acute Toxicity Test Procedure and Protocol in Attachment A of the draft permit requires
the receiving water control sample to be collected immediately upstream of the permitted
discharge’s zone of influence. Given that the River is tidally influenced, the “upstream” and
“downstream” locations will vary over time. Please clarify if these samples are required to be
collected from upstream or downstream of the outfall’s zone of influence, depending on the tide
cycle.
Second, it is unclear how the receiving water data will be used to evaluate compliance with the
permit, given the potential for other sources to impact the results. The pollutant scan results and
WET testing from the effluent and receiving water are indicated as “report only” in the table in
Part I.A.1 of the draft permit. While there are no discharge limits being set for these results, it is
unclear how USEPA will use this data. If there is a detection from the pollutant scan or a failure
of the WET test, will there be the opportunity for the Terminal to collect confirmation samples or
run a confirmatory test before any actions are taken? How will the results from the receiving
water be used in comparison to the effluent results? As discussed below, there are a number of
other known sources in the area of the Terminal’s outfall that could impact the receiving water
samples.
Finally, there are a number of other sources within close proximity to Gulf’s outfall that could
reasonably influence the receiving water results. The point where Outfall 003 enters the River is
located behind a bulkhead that is part of the Terminal dock. The whole area between the shore
and the bulkhead is reasonably considered part of Outfall 003’s zone of influence, as the
discharge will eddy towards the bulkhead. Therefore, collecting the receiving water sample from
this area is not valid.
The next location from which to collect the receiving water sample would be along the
Terminal’s dock. Docked barges and ships would have a deleterious effect on the quality of the
samples that are collected in that area.
The next reasonably accessible upstream location is adjacent to the Chevron Environmental
Management Company’s (CEMC) disposal site with MassDEP Release Tracking Number (RTN)
3-0163. Intermittent sheen at the bulkhead area was observed in 1994 at low tide and was
assigned RTN 3-11905 which was linked to RTN 3-0163 on August 16, 1996. CEMC is
undertaking remedial actions under the Mass. Contingency Plan to address this release. Areas
further north could be influenced by discharges from the Global Terminals.
Upstream and downstream locations in the receiving water could also be influenced by
discharges from vessel operations as they travel up and down the River and historical releases
from other facilities, such as the former Amoco Petroleum terminal that borders the Gulf Oil
Terminal to the south. In 1991, MassDEP listed the site as a confirmed disposal site and issued
Amoco RTN 3-3550. Remediation at the site was conducted to prevent free-phase petroleum
from migrating into the Chelsea River. Based on the most recent Post Response Action Outcome
96

Inspection and Monitoring Report (AnteaGroup, December 30, 2013), between 3.72 and 4.52
feet of product thickness has been observed in 2013 from one well approximately 150 feet from
the Chelsea River.
In addition, in the Fact Sheet that accompanied the draft permit, USEPA states that historically
contaminated sediments as well as municipal sources are continuing sources of impairment to the
Chelsea River.
Given the extent of other sources of impairment to the Chelsea River as discussed above, it is
unclear how analyzing samples of the receiving water will provide an accurate evaluation of the
effects of the Terminal’s stormwater discharge on Chelsea River water quality.
Response to Comment P4:
EPA disagrees that sampling of the receiving water is unlikely to provide useful information on
the impact of the facility’s discharge on the water quality of Chelsea River. As described in
Response to Comment L2 above, and as the Environmental Appeals Board has held, “Section
308(a) [of the CWA] confers broad authority on the Agency to impose monitoring requirements
on any point source.” In re City of Port St. Joe, 7 E.A.D. 275, 306 (EAB 1997); accord In re
Town of Concord, NPDES Appeal No. 13-08, slip op. at 36 (EAB Aug. 28, 2014); see also 33
U.S.C. § 402(a); In re City of Moscow, 10 E.A.D. 135, 170-71 (EAB 2001). “This is true…
regardless of whether pollutant discharges are restricted by an effluent limit.” Town of Concord,
slip op. at 36. “[A]n obvious purpose behind Section 308(a)…is to enable EPA to require
dischargers to gather data so that EPA can make informed regulatory decisions.” Port St. Joe, 7
E.A.D. at 311.
EPA is limited in its ability to complete a quantitative reasonable potential analysis, determine
ambient background concentrations, and quantify the impact of the facility’s discharges alone
and in combination with other point source discharges to the receiving water absent ambient
monitoring data. Furthermore, EPA selected indicator parameters (i.e., benzene, benzo(a)pyrene
and naphthalene) to represent a larger number of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants, for which
Chelsea River is impaired and the facility has been identified as a pollutant source. Therefore, in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C)(3), and to inform future permit decisions, EPA
determined that receiving water sampling for the indicator parameters and selected petroleum
hydrocarbons they are intended to control is required to show during the term of the permit that
the WQBELs for these indicator parameters attain and maintain WQSs such that additional
limitations are not necessary. As discussed in the permits’ fact sheets, quantification of
petroleum hydrocarbons, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, also presents significant
data quality issues. As a result, EPA determined additional information was needed to quantify
the discharges’ impacts on the receiving water where effluent data alone is potentially
incomplete. Further, without sufficient ambient monitoring data, including data regarding whole
effluent toxicity, EPA would be unable to discern the facility’s discharges from the effect of all
discharges in the same small hydrological area and therefore would be prohibited from setting
appropriate, site specific numeric effluent limitations and monitoring requirements. With regard
to the critical importance of data quality improvements expected from increased monitoring, see
Response to Comment B3. The monitoring requirements for the effluent and receiving water
97

were determined on a case-by-case basis as being necessary and appropriate to carry out the
provisions of the Clean Water Act and ensure compliance with Massachusetts’ Surface Water
Quality Standards.
See Response to Comment L2 with regard to the purpose of Whole Effluent Toxicity testing
requirements. The Whole Effluent Toxicity test chemical analysis of the receiving water
(diluent) is included in the protocol for testing of the effluent, Section IV of Attachment A,
Marine Acute Toxicity Test Procedure and Protocol. EPA included the parameters required for
this testing on the DMRs so the information is more readily available. EPA does not believe
reporting the results of this additional testing as part of the facility’s submission of DMRs is
unreasonable. EPA also did not duplicate the pollutants of concern included in the whole effluent
toxicity testing as a separate requirement of the pollutant scan or routine monitoring. The
pollutant scan of the effluent and receiving water has been required to more accurately determine
“background” or ambient concentrations, and better inform EPA’s analysis with regard to
whether the effluent causes or contributes to a violation of Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality
Standards. The parameters included in the pollutant scan were included to ensure that limitation
of an indicator pollutant, in accordance with 40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C), is sufficient to meet
WQSs. Aside from being required pursuant to 40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C), and as required
by the Marine Whole Effluent Toxicity Test Protocol, ambient monitoring is also a factor EPA
considers in performance-based reductions in accordance with the Interim Guidance for
Performance-Based Reduction of NPDES Permit Monitoring Frequencies. Because ambient
monitoring data provide benefits beyond the means to determine NPDES compliance and
compliance with WQSs, the weight of this factor can be important for a permittee. Also see
Response to Comment P4.
With regard to how these data will be used, EPA requires information to carry out the provisions
of the Clean Water Act. For example, ambient conditions and receiving water concentrations of
pollutants are critical to assessing the potential impact of the effluent on the receiving water, to
determining if concentrations cause, or have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an
excursion above water quality criteria, and to establishing appropriate effluent limitations as
recommended in EPA’s Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control.
This is especially critical in situations concerning multiple dischargers, where EPA recommends
that the steady state mixing equation,72 of which ambient receiving water concentrations is a key
variable, is applied sequentially to determine the resulting instream concentration of a pollutant
as a function of distance downstream.73 Should ambient conditions indicate existing designated

uses are further degraded as a result of the limitations in this permit, more stringent limitations
may become necessary to meet WQSs. Likewise, should ambient conditions indicate EPA
applied an overly conservative margin of safety where available information was insufficient, a
relaxation of limitations or requirements may be appropriate and qualifies as one of the few
exceptions to anti-backsliding provisions in Section 402(o) of the Clean Water Act.
With regard to Whole Effluent Toxicity testing, this requirement was included because it is a
means to evaluate the combined effect of pollutants present in the effluent for which data do not
currently exist. EPA will evaluate WET results to determine if the effluent exhibits toxicity
which chemical-specific limitations inadequately address. Effluent and receiving water sampling
associated with the pollutant scan is primarily included in accordance with 40 C.F.R.
§122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C) to ensure additional limitations are not necessary to meet WQSs. EPA
included monitoring, without limits, for additional parameters for which existing effluent data
are absent or insufficient but which were identified as pollutants of concern. EPA notes that since
none of these parameters are limited, a detection does not denote a permit violation. In addition,
in the event these additional parameters are detected, a limit does not automatically become
necessary. First, EPA does not believe single sample points to be representative of either the
effluent or the receiving water and, as a result, has required sampling over a long-term averaging
period, with the possibility of elimination of monitoring following this period. Should a pollutant
scan or a whole effluent chemical analysis detect parameter concentrations at levels of concern to
the permittee, additional confirmatory sampling may be conducted voluntarily. Similarly, if EPA
notes levels of concern that warrant a major permit modification, revocation or reissuance, any
such action will align with regulatory public notification requirements, and EPA will inform the
permittee in advance.
The location and timing of the receiving water sample requirement included in the permit were
written with a degree of flexibility for several reasons, including those noted by the commenter.
When effluent is entering the receiving water on an outgoing tide, it is more appropriate to
collect the receiving water sample upstream of the outfall location. When effluent is entering the
receiving water on an incoming tide, it is more appropriate to collect the receiving water sample
downstream of the outfall location. The commenter is correct that additional near-field
discharges and facilities are likely to impact the receiving water in the vicinity of the outfall.
These conditions are relevant to the quality of the receiving water and the effect of adding to the
pollutant load through discharges from the facility. The receiving water samples should be
reflective of the state of the receiving water. EPA expects that the receiving water samples will
not be pristine, given the available ambient data to date and the impairments to designated uses
in the Chelsea River. Indeed, the monitoring may indicate lower pollutant levels in the facility’s
effluent than in the receiving water. However, if the facility does not sample the actual
conditions into which its effluent discharges, there is increased uncertainty in assessing the
effluent’s actual impact on the receiving water. EPA uses this information to ensure that
allowing such discharges meets the requirements of the Clean Water Act and complies with
Massachusetts’ Surface Water Quality Standards.
In sum, EPA believes there is ample justification for these information gathering requirements
and that these requirements are reasonable and appropriate. See Response to Comment B3,

Comments submitted which pertain to Irving Oil Terminal (#MA0001929):
Comments submitted by Kimble Gorman, Terminal Manager, Irving Oil Terminals, Inc.:
Comment Q1:
1. The proposed effluent monitoring frequencies for benzene, naphthalene, and benzo(a)pyrene
should be modified from monthly to quarterly.
Irving’s 2005 NPDES Permit required quarterly monitoring for benzene, naphthalene, and
benzo(a)pyrene. Irving did not exceed the 2005 NPDES Permit limits for these three compounds
throughout the term of the Permit.
As reported in Attachment 3 of the Draft Permit, the concentration of benzene in the effluent
ranged from 6.14 to 12 micrograms per liter (μg/L) for the period of 2009 through 2013, which is
well below the maximum daily limit of 51 μg/L specified in the 2005 NPDES Permit and the
Draft Permit. Since the benzene effluent concentrations have historically been below the current
and proposed limit and are consistent throughout each quarter of the year (i.e., no significant
monthly variation in concentration), it is believed that quarterly monitoring remains appropriate
for this compound.
For the period of 2009 through 2013, naphthalene was detected in the effluent at concentrations
generally below the method analytical detection limit, which is 1.09 μg/L (i.e., below the 100
μg/L average monthly limit proposed by the Draft Permit). Since the naphthalene effluent
concentrations have historically been below the limit in the Draft Permit and are consistent
throughout each quarter of the year (i.e., no significant monthly variation in concentration), it is
believed that quarterly monitoring remains appropriate for this compound.
The benzo(a)pyrene concentration in the effluent was typically reported at below the detection
limit of 0.109 μg/L during the period of 2009 through 2013. The maximum benzo(a)pyrene ever
detected in the effluent was at a concentration slightly above the detection limit in June 2010
(i.e., 0.185 μg/L). The proposed compliance level for benzo(a)pyrene is 0.018 μg/L, but the
USEPA indicated that it will accept a compliance level set at the method detection limit of 0.1
μg/L. Since the benzo(a)pyrene effluent concentrations have historically been below the limit
proposed in the Draft Permit and the concentrations are consistent throughout each quarter of the
year (i.e., no significant monthly variation in concentration), it is believed that quarterly
monitoring remains appropriate for this compound.
Response to Comment Q1:
See Response to Comment L2 and Response to Comment P1, as the comment is substantially
identical. The permittee may request monitoring frequency reduction after a minimum of three
years following the effective date of the permit.
100

Comment Q2:
2. The proposed monitoring for methyl tert-butyl ether (MtBE) should be eliminated.
Irving’s 2005 NPDES Permit required quarterly monitoring for MtBE. As reported in
Attachment 3 of the Draft Permit, the MtBE effluent concentrations for the period of 2009
through 2013 ranged from <5 μg/L (non-detect, ND) to 61.4 μg/L, and were typically in the
range of 7 to 9.6 μg/L, well below the proposed Draft Permit limit of 20 μg/L. On one occasion
during that period (March 2009), MtBE was detected at a concentration of 61.4 μg/L. Since the
MtBE effluent concentrations have historically been below the limit proposed in the Draft Permit
and MtBE is no longer used at the Revere Terminal, it is believed that monitoring for this
compound is no longer necessary.
Response to Comment Q2:
See Response to Comment M12, and Response to Comment N11, as the comment is
substantially identical.
As described in the permit’s fact sheet, and noted in the comment, from January 1, 2009 through
December 31, 2013, concentrations of MtBE ranged from below the PQL to 61.4 µg/L at Outfall
001. As the reasonable potential analysis describes, effluent concentrations have reasonable
potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above applicable water quality criteria. For these
and the additional reasons detailed in Response to Comment M12 and Response to Comment
N11, EPA retains the WQBEL in the final permit of 20 µg/L for MtBE.
Comment Q3:
3. The proposed annual receiving water (i.e., Chelsea River) Pollutant Scan and Whole Effluent
Toxicity (WET) Testing Chemical Analysis should be eliminated.
The Draft Permit proposes that Irving be required to conduct a Pollutant Scan of both its effluent
and the receiving waters (i.e., Chelsea River) annually during the month of May, as well as WET
Testing Chemical Analysis during the month of September. It has not been demonstrated how
the results of the receiving stream Pollutant Scan and WET Testing Chemical analytical data will
be used in a meaningful way to assess potential impacts of Irving’s discharge on the Chelsea
River, and why annual stream quality monitoring should be the responsibility of, and undertaken
at cost to the permittee. Irving does not object to conducting an annual Pollutant Scan and WET
Testing of its effluent. However, the proposed Pollutant Scan and WET Testing Chemical
Analysis of the receiving waters should be eliminated.
Response to Comment Q3:
See Response to Comment L2 and Response to Comment P4, as the comment is substantially
identical. The Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) Testing Chemical Analysis is required by the
Marine Whole Effluent Toxicity Test Protocol. Since Irving does not object to conducting the
101

Whole Effluent Toxicity testing of the effluent, EPA expects that the required protocol will be
used, in which case, the receiving water sample will be analyzed for the listed parameters. EPA
included the parameters required for this testing on the DMRs so the information is more readily
available. EPA does not believe reporting the results of this additional testing as part of the
facility’s submission of DMRs is unreasonable.
Comment Q4:
4. There are several possible errors in Attachment 3, Discharge Monitoring Data, of the Draft
Permit.
Attachment 3, Discharge Monitoring Data, includes a table that presents sampling data collected
between January 31, 2009 and December 31, 2013 for Flow (from Oil/Water Separators 1 and 2),
pH, Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and Oil and Grease (OG). Attachment 3 also presents a
summary of the data, including the minimum measurement, maximum measurement, average
measurement, standard deviation of the measurements, and the total number of measurements
conducted during the period of January 31, 2009 to December 31, 2013.
The summary data presented for pH and OG contain potential errors. The pH measurements
listed in the data table ranged from 6.7 to 8.4 (i.e., all measurements were within the acceptable
range of measurements specified by Irving’s 2005 NPDES Permit). However, the summary table
indicates a maximum pH of 9.3 was detected. This measurement, which would represent an
exceedance of the 2005 NPDES Permit conditions, is not shown in the data table. The OG
measurements listed in the data table ranged from ND to 6.19 milligrams per liter (mg/L) (i.e., all
measurements were below the maximum monthly limit specified by Irving’s 2005 NPDES
Permit). However, the summary table indicates a maximum OG concentration of 139 mg/L was
detected. This measurement, which would represent an exceedance of the 2005 NPDES Permit
conditions, is not shown in the data table.
Response to Comment Q4:
EPA notes the corrections. The specific errors noted are data points reported prior to the five
year period of review but were reported since the issuance of the existing permit, as obtained
from EPA’s Integrated Compliance and Information System (ICIS). Oil & Grease was reported
at 139 mg/L for the December 31, 2008 monitoring period and pH was reported at 9.3 standard
units for the September 30, 2008 monitoring period. When EPA updated Attachment 3 to the
most recent five year period at the time of draft permit issuance, previously tabulated data was
removed. However, these values were not corrected in the summary statistics. Because fact
sheets (and their attachments) are generally considered final documents that are not changed in
response to comments, EPA acknowledges the noted errors. The Response to Comments serves
as the official correction.
Comment Q5:

102

5. The Draft Permit should specify a time period for compliance with the flow monitoring
requirements to provide time for the Terminal to modify the piping and install flow metering
equipment.
The Draft Permit requires that Irving monitor the effluent flow rate using a totalizer or similar
device. Irving does not currently operate this type of equipment and will need to modify the
stormwater collection piping and install new equipment to comply with the proposed Draft
Permit flow monitoring requirements. Irving requests that the Draft Permit specify that the
Terminal be in compliance with the flow monitoring requirements within 180 days after final
permit issuance to provide sufficient time to purchase the equipment and implement the required
piping modifications. EPA should continue to allow Irving to estimate flow rates during the 180day compliance period.
Response to Comment Q5:
EPA agrees that sufficient time is necessary to install the required device such that it does not
interfere with the current level of treatment and control of discharges from the facility.
Therefore, the final permit includes the requested six month time period for installation of the
required flow meter and allows the current method of estimating flow in the interim. Also see
Response to Comment L3 and P3.
Comments submitted which pertain to Sunoco Logistics Terminal (#MA0004006):
Comments submitted by Marguerite A. Porrini, Environmental Compliance Specialist,
Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals L.P.:
Comment R1:
The remediation system that discharge from Outfall 002 to Sunoco’s Outfall 001 has not been
operational for over 1 year. I am being told that it might not be operational again as other means
for disposing of the groundwater associated with the remediation system are being explored. I
wanted to double check with you since I noticed that a lot of our requirements in this permit are
triggered by the discharge of the remediation system. Will we be able to reopen the permit and
revise requirements associated with Outfall 002 if it will no longer be discharging to our outfall
001? I don’t want to do it yet as I’m not 100% sure of the plans, I just wanted to keep the option
open.
Response to Comment R1:
Should the groundwater remediation effluent be eliminated, the permittee should request a
permit modification to eliminate Outfall 002. In addition, the commenter is correct that several
conditions included at Outfall 001 are related to the expected quality of effluent at Outfall 002. If
Outfall 002 is eliminated, the information on which requirements at Outfall 001 were based may
have changed. As a result, the permittee may elect to additionally request permit modification
for Outfall 001. The Permittee may request such a modification pursuant to 40 C.F.R. §122.62.

103

Comment R2:
Since waste water treatment system effluent results are the only results assessed for compliance
with the permit requirements SPMT requests the sampling scenario is revised:
For river water: (1) sample at fill to establish baseline pollutant levels, (2) at influent to the waste
water treatment system at the beginning and end of discharge to show in-process monitoring and
(1) sample at waste water treatment effluent.
For potable water sources: (2) samples at the influent to the waste water treatment system during
the beginning and end of discharge to show in-process monitoring and (1) sample at waste water
treatment effluent. Baseline samples for anything other than residual chlorine should not be
required for potable water.
SPMT asks to eliminate the effluent sample from the tank entirely. By the time analytical results
for the effluent from the tank are received, the water will already have mixed with other facility
stormwater.
Response to Comment R2:
See Response to Comment L6, as comment is substantially identical. Hydrostatic testing
sampling requirements were included to be consistent with facilities discharging this type of
effluent region-wide under EPA’s Remediation General Permit. However, EPA agrees that the
tank effluent monitoring requirements can be eliminated as the effluent at all facilities receives
treatment and is subject to effluent limitations after treatment. However, in Response to
Comment B7, effluent monitoring has been modified to collect samples representative of
multiple stages of hydrostatic test water discharges. If the permittee utilizes municipal water
supply for hydrostatic testing, the total number of samples required in the final permits for
hydrostatic testing represents a net decrease relative to the total number of samples required for
hydrostatic testing in the draft permits.
Comment R3:
Naphthalene sampling requirements – The facility TBEL for naphthalene is more stringent than
EPA’s lifetime health advisory value of 100 µg/L. SPMT understands that the more stringent
requirements are for anti-backsliding requirements, however since the limit has only been
exceeded on occasion and SPMT is adhering to a more stringent limit, SPMT requests that this
parameter is reduced from the proposed monthly frequency.
Response to Comment R3:
See Response to Comment L2 and Response to Comment P1, as comment is substantially
identical. The permittee may request monitoring frequency reduction after a minimum of three
years following the effective date of the permit.
Part III. Comments submitted on the Environmental Justice Analysis:
104

Comments submitted by Ek OngKar Singh Khalsa, Executive Director, Mystic River
Watershed Association:
Comment B9:
8. The environmental justice analysis fails to assess cumulative impacts of all seven terminals
contributing pollutants to the Chelsea Creek. MyRWA recommends that such cumulative
impacts be assessed and evaluated.
Response to Comment B9:
EPA considered cumulative impacts in the development of the permits as prescribed by EPA
policy and guidance. See Response to Comment C1. As explained in the EJA, the reasonable
potential analyses and any WQBELs established thereafter to comply with water quality
standards, inherently account for cumulative effects of multiple discharges of a particular
pollutant to the receiving water. When determining whether a permittee’s discharge of that
pollutant will cause, or have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion
above water quality criteria, or which violate Massachusetts’ WQSs, and again when calculating
a WQBEL that will achieve water quality standards in the receiving water, EPA considered the
upstream or background concentration of a particular pollutant in the receiving water, if
available. EPA notes, however, that a cumulative impact analysis need not necessarily be
quantitative. Therefore, under the scope of the Clean Water Act, EPA’s approach considered the
data available, the nature of the water quality concerns, the sources of pollutants and their
characteristics, and the relationships among those sources following EPA guidance.
As explained more thoroughly in the permits’ fact sheets, in developing the effluent limitations
and monitoring requirements for the reissuance of the permits, EPA considered cumulative
effects of the loading of pollutants to the receiving water, including additive and/or synergistic
effects. For example, EPA evaluated and imposed effluent limitations and monitoring
requirements for Group II PAHs, which are not necessarily carcinogenic alone, but may enhance
the carcinogenic effect of Group I PAHs. EPA considered each facility as a point source in the
context of other point sources (including the six other facilities), non-point sources, as they can
be discerned using available receiving water data, and the physical and chemical conditions of
the receiving water. In general, as the background level of the pollutant increases, EPA’s weight
of evidence that a pollutant or pollutant parameter causes, has the reasonable potential to cause,
or contributes to an excursion above water quality criteria increases. The goal of this process is
to ensure that the combined pollutant sources do not result in an excursion above any water
quality criterion downstream of the discharge. If the upstream or background concentration
already exceeds water quality standards, then that pollutant is typically limited to the water
quality criterion for that pollutant at the point of discharge, also referred to as a “criteria end-ofpipe” limit. In this way, since the concentration in the effluent cannot exceed the applicable
water quality criterion, the discharge cannot cause the receiving water to exceed the criterion.
Thus, pursuant to EPA’s authority under the Clean Water Act, the permits address potential
cumulative impacts to water quality of multiple sources that otherwise could adversely affect
human health or the environment.

See Response to Comment C1, Response to Comment C4, Response to Comment C6, and
Response to Comment G1.
Comments submitted by Staci Rubin, Senior Attorney, Environmental Justice Legal
Services Director, Alternatives for Community & Environment, Inc., on behalf of residents
of Chelsea and East Boston
Comment C6:
II. Below are comments regarding the Environmental Justice Analysis.
The EPA defines environmental justice as the “fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all
people” with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental
laws, regulations, and policies.7 “Fair treatment” means that no group of people, including racial,
ethnic, or socioeconomic groups, should bear a disproportionate share of the negative
environmental impacts resulting from industrial, municipal, and commercial operations or the
execution of federal, state, local, and tribal environmental programs and policies. “Meaningful
involvement” means that (a) potentially affected community residents have an appropriate
opportunity to participate in decisions about a proposed activity that will affect their environment
and/or health; (b) the public’s contribution can influence the regulatory agency’s decision; (c) the
concerns of all participants involved will be considered in the decision-making process; and (d)
the decision makers seek out and facilitate the involvement of those potentially affected. That
language along with Executive Order 12,898 provides both procedural and substantive
obligations for the EPA and MassDEP.
The residents commend the EPA for making efforts to increase public participation in the
NPDES permitted process. The residents thank the EPA and MassDEP for holding a public
hearing at a convenient location and providing both translated documents in advance of the
informational meeting and interpretation at the public hearing. I appreciate that EPA took the
time to meet with ACE and members of the Chelsea Creek Action Group on three occasions and
held a community meeting last June about the NPDES process. While EPA’s Environmental
Justice Analysis is the most robust of those I have seen in Region 1, additional analyses are
necessary. First, an explanation is needed as to why the EPA selected a 0.5 mile radius to
evaluate demographics and impacts. Residents of Chelsea, East Boston, and Revere living
beyond 0.5 miles of the Chelsea River attempt to use and enjoy access points to the River and are
impacted by the EPA’s and MassDEP’s decision to issue NPDES permits. According to the
Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, the areas in the 0.5 radius
and beyond are identified as environmental justice populations.8
Second, the Environmental Justice Analysis (“EJA”) indicated through the screening process that
the facilities are located in an area with a significant percentage of people of color and low
income residents. The EJA also indicated a significant number of polluting facilities located in
close proximity to the facilities at issue for these draft permits. The EJA does not conclude that
these populations are overburdened despite evidence to the contrary. Because the location of
these seven bulk petroleum terminals are in an area with recognized environmental justice
populations and a concentration of environmentally regulated facilities, the agencies have a
106

responsibility to require substantive changes to the permits and that the facility operators provide
community benefits to offset their pollution and associated health risks.
Third, the EJA requires additional health information. EPA’s somewhat recently developed tool
Community-Focused Exposure and Risk Screening Tool (“C-FERST”) should be consulted to
identify additional health information for Boston, Chelsea, and Revere such as cancer incidence
rates (not merely cancer death rates) particularly for those cancers associated with exposure to
benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other materials stored and handled at oil
terminals. Moreover, there should be some analysis of whether health indicators in the study area
or host cities demonstrate health inequities (e.g., whether the health of one racial or ethnic group
is significantly higher than other racial or ethnic groups and how they compare with the
statewide average). The EJA should include a risk assessment that truly estimates risk of the
population that comes in contact with the Chelsea River such as fishermen, kayakers, and
volunteers that clean up public beaches and other waterfront locations in the Chelsea River.
The EPA concludes in its EJA that because the agency proposes effluent limits in the draft
permits that will ensure the facilities do not cause or contribute to violations of water quality
standards, the permitting action will not have a disproportionately high and adverse human
health and/or environmental effect. This conclusory statement does not discuss how the effluent
limits will improve the water quality nor does it discuss how resident health in the abutting
neighborhoods is improved or worsened by permitting these facilities. The concept of
environmental justice requires substantive improvements in overburdened communities, such as
Chelsea, East Boston, and Revere. The EPA and MassDEP should require a net decrease in
pollutants. The agencies could require the facilities to establish that they will release no pollution
or offset the pollutants by an amount greater than their pollutant releases in the Mystic River
Watershed. The EJA notes that the Chelsea River is not of a high enough quality to support
recreation. Yet, the EJA makes no effort to discuss how permitting seven bulk petroleum
terminals will affect the quality of life for nearby residents.
Response to Comment C6:
As part of the EJA, EPA selected an area of focus that encompassed all seven bulk petroleum
storage facilities and populations within 0.5 miles of the Chelsea River including portions of
Chelsea, East Boston, and Revere, Massachusetts. Because the permits at issue regulate
discharges primarily to the Chelsea River and because NPDES permits in general regulate
discharges in accordance with water quality standards established pursuant to the Clean Water
Act, the Chelsea River represents a logical location of focus for the study of potential human
and/or ecological impacts. EPA then chose an area that encompassed populations within 0.5
miles of the Chelsea River to assess whether disproportionate impacts might be experienced by
populations as a result of issuance of the seven NPDES permits. EPA chose a 0.5 mile study area
that would capture characteristics relevant to the population most likely to be impacted by the
permit renewals, while not so large as to influence the analysis with characteristics of
populations that might experience lesser or even no impacts as a consequence of issuance of the
seven permits. As a result of comments received on the EJ Analysis that asked that the Agency
expand the EJ Analysis radius, EPA has updated Sections III.A, III.B, and III.C of the EJ
Analysis. EPA now describes the social demographics, environment, and health of the
107

community located within 1.0 miles of the Chelsea River. The results of this new analysis can
be found in Appendix 1.
As explained in Response to Comment C1, Executive Order 12898 (Federal Actions to Address
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations) grants no
additional authority to EPA; any NPDES permit renewal must be in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations, including the Clean Water Act. EPA thoroughly considered environmental
justice issues in the development of the draft permits and believes that it has used its authority
under the Clean Water Act to incorporate appropriate limits and conditions sufficiently
connected to water quality impacts or technology-based limitations that address environmental
justice concerns documented in the EJA. Moreover, the final permits incorporate a majority of
the specific changes requested by the commenter in Comment C2. See Response to Comment
C2. Inasmuch as the commenter may be asserting that the Executive Order requires that the
permittees be compelled to provide the “community benefits” referred to in Comment C5, it is
not clear to EPA how several of these requests are connected to water quality impacts or
technology-based limitations. Nor has the commenter provided such an explanation. Regarding
the request for an independent data interpreter, see Response to Comment C5.
The commenter also requests that EPA consult C-FERST for cancer incidence rates (not merely
cancer death rates). This tool is still being refined and has not been formally released, and as
such, it is not appropriate for public use at this time. However, cancer incidence rates are
available from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (“MassDPH”) by community for
select cancer types. Cancer incidence rates for several cancer types have been presented in
Appendix 2 based on the tumor types associated with key petroleum constituents included in the
NPDES permits. Two key constituents of petroleum that are carcinogenic and included in the
NPDES permits include benzene which is known to cause leukemia in humans and
benzo(a)pyrene, a PAH that is a probable human carcinogen based on evidence that it causes
stomach, larynx, and esophageal tumors in laboratory animals. While other PAHs with
carcinogenic potential are present in petroleum products (e.g. benzo(a)anthracene), as a matter of
policy, EPA indexes the toxicity of carcinogenic PAHs to that of the more thoroughly studied
benzo(a)pyrene. Consequently, benzo(a)pyrene is commonly used as a surrogate for these other
carcinogenic PAHs. Other constituents in petroleum include hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene,
xylenes), but these have not been classified as to their carcinogenicity by EPA or the
International Agency for Research on Cancer.
Standard incidence ratios (SIRs)74 for select tumor types relevant to several key constituents
included in the NPDES permits are presented in Appendix 2. Because the State aggregates data
over a five year interval to generate the SIRs, incidence rates from two different reporting
periods corresponding to 2003-2007 (Table 1) and 2005-2009 (Table 2) have been presented.
Standard Incidence Ratio (SIRs) represent the observed number of cancer cases (for the period of interest)
divided by the expected number of cases based on state-specific average annual age-specific incidence rates, which
is then multiplied by 100. A SIR is an indirect method of adjustment for age and sex that describes in numerical
terms how a city or town's cancer experience in a given time period compares with that of the state as a whole. An
SIR of more than 100 indicates that a city/town's incidence of a certain type of cancer is higher than expected for
that type of cancer based on statewide average annual age-specific incidence rates whereas a SIR less than 100 is
lower than expected based on statewide average age-specific incidence rates.
74

108

Additionally the 95 percent confidence interval75 around the SIR has also been presented
indicating whether the observed number of cancer cases was significantly different76 from the
expected number of cases, or whether the observed difference was most likely due to chance.
In helping to interpret the SIR findings presented in Appendix 2, one notices that several tumor
types rose to the level of statistical significance in several communities (depicted by shading in
Appendix 2, Tables 1 and 2) however many of the elevated incidence ratios had very wide
confidence intervals suggesting that the incidence ratios reported are quite unstable.
Specifically, elevated incidence ratios of larynx cancer in females (Chelsea 2003-2007, Everett
2005-2009) and stomach cancers in females (Chelsea, Boston, and Everett 2005-2009) were
noted. Unfortunately, the cause or causes for the statistically significant elevated SIRs cannot be
ascertained from the available information. However, one can begin to look for trends over time
to help ascertain whether tumor specific SIRs may be elevated chronically in communities of
interest. In doing so, SIRs for stomach cancers were not available for the 2003-2007 reporting
period so statements about the longevity of these elevated ratios cannot be made. The elevated
SIRs of larynx cancers in females observed in Chelsea 2003-2007 could not be corroborated with
SIRs from the 2005-2009 reporting period as too few cancers of the larynx in females were
observed during the 2005-2009 reporting period. In contrast, data were available for both
reporting periods for Everett yet the SIR of larynx cancer in females did not rise to the level of
statistical significance across both five year periods 2003-2007 and 2005-2009 suggesting that
the elevated ratios observed may have been influenced by a short-term spike rather than a
chronically elevated increase in the number of cases.
In addressing the comment regarding health inequities in the region, while some data on health
disparities by race and ethnicity for things such as births, perinatal information, health care and
risk factors, and causes of death are available for the cities of Boston and Revere,77 similar data
for the cities of Chelsea and Everett are either unavailable and/or highly unstable (e.g. because
counts are so low for the data period used by the MassDPH). Consequently, a few highlights
from a MassDPH 2007 report summarizing health disparities for various regions of
Massachusetts including the Greater Boston Region (which includes Boston, Chelsea, Revere,
Winthrop, and Brookline) were chosen and have been reported in Appendix 3.78 Moreover,
A confidence interval is a range of values around a measurement that indicates the precision of the measurement.
If the 95% confidence interval range does not include the value 100, then the number of observed cases is
significantly different from the expected number of cases. When the confidence interval around the SIR does contain
the value 100, there is no significant difference between the observed and expected numbers. Statistically, the width
of the confidence interval reflects the size of the population and the number of events; smaller populations and
smaller observed numbers of cases yield less precise estimates that have wider confidence intervals. Wide
confidence intervals indicate instability, meaning that small changes in the observed or expected number of cases
would change the SIR a great deal.
75

‘Significantly different’ means there is at most a 5% chance that the difference between the number of observed
and expected cancer cases is due solely to chance alone.

caution should be made in extrapolating these findings to the study area around Chelsea River
because these statistics were derived from a regional dataset which is heavily influenced by the
racial, ethnic, and age profile of the Greater Boston Regional population.
In reviewing premature mortality rates (a good indicator of overall health) as presented in
Appendix 3, and focusing on the data in the Greater Boston Region which tends to be younger
than the comparable statewide population used for comparison, White Non-Hispanics, Black
Non-Hispanics and Asian Non-Hispanics tended to have a higher premature mortality rate in
comparison to the same populations groups state-wide whereas Hispanics in the Greater Boston
Region tend to have a lower premature mortality rate based on data collected during the 20032005 reporting period. Infant mortality rates for Black Non-Hispanics in the Greater Boston
Region slightly exceeded the statewide rate used for comparison, whereas the infant mortality
rate for other races and ethnic groups in the Greater Boston Region were lower than the
statewide rates for 2003-2005. The rates by which all race and ethnicity groups sought medical
assistance at a hospital for pediatric asthma (emergency department visits), diabetes
(hospitalizations), and hypertension (hospitalizations) were almost always greater in the Greater
Boston Region than compared to the statewide rate for 2003-2005 suggesting that these diseases
are either less well managed or that the symptoms require more serious medical assistance in the
Greater Boston Region. However the death rates reported for 2003-2005 for diabetes and heart
disease in the population groups for the Greater Boston Region, save for White Non-Hispanics,
were the same or lower than for comparable population groups in the state, suggesting that while
these populations may seek medical assistance for these conditions at a greater rate, they are not
dying from these diseases at greater rates than was observed statewide 2003-2005.
As to the suggestion that EPA should conduct a risk assessment to characterize the risk to
fishermen, kayakers, and volunteers who may come in contact with the Chelsea River, a sitespecific human health risk assessment is beyond the scope of an EJ Analysis conducted in
conjunction with issuance of permits under the Federal Clean Water Act. EPA notes, however,
that WQBELs in the permits are derived from water quality criteria that have been developed to
protect against adverse impacts to human health and the environment. The WQBELs are required
where EPA determined they were more stringent than TBELs and are necessary to meet
Massachusetts’ WQSs for the designated uses of the Chelsea River. As a Class SB waterbody,
these uses include primary and secondary contact recreation as well as fish consumption and
shellfishing.
In EPA’s judgment, the reissued permits will lead to water quality improvements in the Chelsea
River. The Chelsea River is listed as impaired for its designated uses for the pollutant “petroleum
hydrocarbons,” the cause of which is “petroleum.” Since Massachusetts’ WQSs do not contain
numeric or narrative criteria specifically for petroleum or petroleum hydrocarbons for Class SB
waters, EPA used the state’s narrative criterion for toxics, which states, “waters shall be free
from pollutants in concentrations or combinations that are toxic to humans, aquatic life or
wildlife.” The pollutant “petroleum hydrocarbons” consists of many hundreds of individual
compounds, the precise combination and composition of which can vary significantly, but are
known to contain several pollutants or pollutant classes that exhibit toxicity and pose an
environmental or health risk. Rather than limiting all the possible individual compounds in
“petroleum hydrocarbons” to meet the narrative criterion, EPA determined that it is more
110

protective and efficient to regulate indicator parameters that share physical and/or chemical
characteristics with other pollutants in the pollutant class. Therefore, EPA selected the most
conservative individual toxicants for which National Recommended Water Quality Criteria exist,
as indicator parameters. EPA determined that for the most limiting parameters, the most stringent
applicable criteria were the human health criteria established for protection via the consumption
of aquatic organisms. Additionally, the final permits contain several narrative requirements
applicable to all designated uses based on 314 C.M.R. §4.05(5). Monitoring requirements
specific to these criteria, and based on the impairments to the Chelsea River have also been
included, mainly for pollutants for which monitoring data either have not been collected or
insufficient data exist to complete an analysis to determine if the concentrations in the discharges
cause, or have reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above water quality
criteria. Overall, the re-issued permits include more stringent numeric limits, technological,
operational, and implementation controls to address pollutant loading significantly beyond that
of the previous permits and impose narrative and non-numeric TBELs. They also include
enhanced monitoring and sampling requirements for both the effluent and receiving water to
assess additive and/or synergistic effects that might exceed water quality standards, including
biological monitoring via toxicity. Thus, the permits decrease pollutant discharges to the Chelsea
River and increase the level of environmental protection. Furthermore, the permitted facilities are
subject to specific discharge prohibitions (e.g., tank bottom and bilge water) and requirements
for on-going operation and maintenance, including annual inspections, corrective actions, and
requirements to ensure that all collection and treatment systems are properly operated and
maintained. These detailed permitting requirements provide EPA and MassDEP with additional
assurance that the discharges from these facilities are being effectively addressed. For these
reasons, EPA believes the reissued permits will improve water quality in the Chelsea River.

Comments submitted by Matthew Frank, President, Chelsea City Council:
Comment F1:
Matthew Frank. I'm president of the Chelsea City Council. Welcome, EPA and DEP to my
chambers.
My concern is, I am not sure if the cumulative effects of each of the seven terminals is being
taken into account. I do understand that, if you regulate each one, then, in theory that would
work out. But, if you have seven, and they're all discharging the maximum amount, I do have a
concern that it could lead to way too much. The same way that one person speaking with their
indoor voices, as those in the education field would say, is fine. But, if everybody in this room
started speaking kind of in that rabble, rabble way that sometimes people do, it becomes
unbearable and you can't hear what's going on.
I also do have concern about the Environmental Justice half mile assessment. I represent a
district in the city over near, I generally say, between the Home Depot, the wind turbine, and the
water tank up at Soldier's Home. And I know Sue is one of my constituents. We're not within the
half mile radius. But, we are on the Mill Creek, which comes off of the Chelsea Creek. And
anything that happens in the Chelsea Creek goes up the Mill Creek right into that neighborhood.
We have many under water waterways that run underneath the neighborhood. The flooding of
my basement every time it rains kind of help proves that. Even if the sump pump is going full
blast, there's always water down there, because the water's running through. Because it used to
be the clay pits as most people in this room remember. So, that is a concern of mine, that we
actually have four buildings in my neighborhood right on the creek that house people who have
they're -- that are run by the housing authority. So, the big red building at that end, at the very
end of Clark Ave. We also have a lot of low income residents right on the Creek, including a
minority population, of Latino descent. I know, there's also a lot of white people in my
neighborhood. But, we do have a minority population specifically on the Chelsea Creek itself.
I would say there is a concern that the permitting process doesn't include accidents that happened
outside of that one particular pipe. So, if oil gets spilled in the transferring process, it's my
understanding that the permits don’t include anything that is happening outside of what they're
putting into the pipe and that's going into the water.
112

The last thing I would say, and that would -- it might not be completely relevant. But, one of the
concerns I've always had as a member of the planning board, then a member of the council, and
now as president, is, people often say to me, why do we need to have these seven oil tanks? Why
do we need all of this industrial use on the waterfront? I personally get asked all the time why I
let that happen. And my concern is, I let that happen because we can't do anything else. The state
tells us this has to be maritime use, specifically where these tanks are, it has to be maritime
industrial use because of a state regulation. And that's a real concern of mine, because we try to
clean up the creek. And we've done so -- we pull carriages out of the water. I've personally been
up to my knees pulling stuff out of the creek. And no matter what we do, we still end up with oil
tanks on the creek. We still end up with pollution coming into the community. And I realize that
the limits have been reduced in some of these new permits. But, it's still happening. And when
you've got seven, my hope is that we can at least -- that's something in the future we can push
away.
But, in the meantime, I would like to see gradual movement, the same way that the auto
regulations are pushed 20 or 30 years into the future, we already kind of know what the federal
government wants in 20 or 30 years. My hope is that we can build a timeline for things like these
permits that say, okay. Well, today, technology will only allow, you know, five – milligrams per
liter. But, maybe in five years, it could be four. And with the hope that we could push facilities to
get to zero.
But, thank you so much. Like I said, welcome again.

Comments submitted by Madeleine Scammell, Chelsea Board of Health:
Comment G1:
Thank you. My name is Madeline Scammell. I'm a resident of Chelsea. I serve on the Board of
Health. I'm an environmental health scientist myself. I study cumulative risk analysis. I'm one of
EPA's grantees under the STAR program in partnership with the Chelsea Collaborative. But, I
don't have to do any really fancy analyses to recognize cumulative exposures as in this situation.
And so, I guess, I have a comment and a question, which I understand you can't answer now.
But, I would like to be on the record.
I feel like the Environmental Justice analysis that was done was nice for characterizing our city
as it is and the health of Chelsea Creek, or Chelsea River as it's called. But, the conclusion just
surprises me. EPA acknowledges that the Chelsea River and surrounding communities are
impacted by many environmental burdens. Yes. That is the case. And yet, has determined that
the facility's discharges will not result in disproportionately high environmental effects.

113

The benzene concentrations that are allowed, 51 micrograms per liter, are typical of NPDES
permits and are not lower than this typical amount for any of the seven permits that are being
considered today. And seven permits equals a lot more than 51. I don't know what the flow rate
is in terms of what will actually be discharged to result in the water quality concentration of
benzene. But, I do know that toxic effects on aquatic species have been found at 700 micrograms
per liter. So, that's not a whole lot more than 51 without doing any calculations. And while 51
micrograms per liter is a low amount, it's orders of magnitude higher than the drinking water
standard. And we don't drink that water, of course. But, we do muck around in it sometimes, like
on April 26th when we're going to clean the Chelsea Creek.
And as an Environmental Justice community, it's not so much about the health effects as it is
quality of life. And I feel like EPA Region 1 has a real opportunity to make a point that 51 may
be typical. But, here, we can reduce it and we can make a difference in terms of reducing
cumulative effects on our environment and our ability to enjoy the environment. So, with that, I
will just thank you again for being here.
Response to Comment G1:
EPA acknowledges that certain environmental burdens may affect the quality of life for impacted
communities. As noted in Response to Comment C1, the Clean Water Act does not appear to
provide any general authority to impose permit conditions based on environmental justice
considerations that are unconnected to water quality impacts or technology-based limitations. As
such, permit conditions focus on TBELs, both numeric and non-numeric, and requirements such
as control measures, including best management practices, and corrective actions, and water
quality impacts, including numeric limitations and narrative requirements. As noted in the EJA,
reasonable potential analyses and any WQBELs established thereafter to comply with the Clean
Water Act and Massachusetts’ WQSs take into account the cumulative effects of multiple
contributors of a particular pollutant to the receiving water, including known concentrations of
existing levels of the pollutant in the receiving water. Additionally, effluent limits are derived
from criteria that have been developed to protect against adverse impacts to human health and
the environment. As written, the final permits include effluent limits and additional conditions
that will ensure discharges from the permitted facilities do not cause or contribute to excursions
above Massachusetts’ water quality standards, including narrative criteria applicable to toxic
pollutants, including benzene, a limiting pollutant for petroleum hydrocarbons with applicable
National Recommended Water Quality Criteria. The applicable criteria for multiple toxic
pollutants, including benzene, were applied directly at the point of discharge. Thus, EPA
concluded in the EJA that EPA’s reissuance of the seven NPDES permits will not have
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or lowincome populations within the meaning of Executive Order 12898. Also see Response to
Comment C1 and Response to Comment G1 in Part I.
While the commenter appears to suggest that adding the concentrations of benzene in the
discharges of all the facilities together equals an in-stream concentration of benzene in the
Chelsea River higher than the current human health “organism-only” criterion for benzene
(51 µg/L), a simple summation of the limits is not a valid method for determining whether the
water quality criterion for benzene will be exceeded, because the limits and the criterion are
114

concentration-based, not mass-based. Also see Response to Comment G1 in Part I, above. EPA
continues to believe that the conclusion in the EJA is valid, and the commenter’s suggestion
provides no basis to alter that conclusion.
Although understandably not mentioned in the comment, the Region is aware that EPA proposed
draft updates to the 2002 National Recommended Water Quality Criteria for human health after
the public comment period for these permits expired.79 Of the 94 chemical pollutants for which
EPA has proposed draft updated criteria, the permits include effluent limitations to the Chelsea
River for two: benzene and benzo(a)pyrene. In the permits, effluent limits for benzene are
generally set at 51 µg/L – although limits at some of the outfalls are as low as 5 µg/L80 – and
benzo(a)pyrene limits are set at 0.018 µg/L. Based on Massachusetts’ WQSs, EPA derived the
WQBELs in the permits for benzene using the upper bound of the current human health
“organism-only” criteria for benzene, 51 µg/L81 and for benzo(a)pyrene using the current human
health “organism-only” criterion for benzo(a)pyrene, 0.018 µg/L.82 Indeed, the Region is
required to apply the 2002 recommended criteria; it cannot use the draft updates to the
recommended water quality criteria to derive effluent limits in a NPDES permit unless and until
the criteria are finalized by EPA, adopted by Massachusetts into its WQSs, and those standards
are reviewed and approved by EPA.83 Accordingly, the Region has not used the draft criteria to
conduct reasonable potential analyses or derive effluent limits in these permits.
In the recent draft update to the recommended criteria, EPA has proposed to lower the criteria for
benzene and benzo(a)pyrene to a range of 6.2 to 23 µg/L84 and 0.00084 µg/L, respectively.85 The
release of these draft criteria, however, does not change the Region’s conclusion in the EJA that
Updated National Recommended Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Human Health, 79 Fed. Reg. 27,303
(proposed May 13, 2014).
80
Effluent limits for the seven facilities differ based on, among other things, whether the limit is technology-based
or water quality-based and whether it applies to an internal or primary outfall.
81
A range of cancer slope factors in EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System are used to derive the recommended
criteria for benzene, resulting in a human health “organism only” range of 14 µg/L to 51 µg/L (see IRIS Benzene
CASRN 71-43-2 (01/19/2000)). However, EPA recommends the use of the upper limit in the criteria table to
establish the upper bound of the average ambient concentration that should not be exceeded and considers such a
criterion scientifically defensible (see EPA-822-R-02-047, November 2002).

the re-issuance of the permits will not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or
environmental effects on minority or low-income populations. First, the draft updated criteria for
benzene and benzo(a)pyrene, which were made available for public comment to solicit scientific
views for roughly 90 days, a period that ended on August 13, 2014, are only draft criteria.86
Consequently, the draft criteria are currently being assessed in light of the comments received
and have been neither finalized at the levels proposed nor actually recommended by EPA for
inclusion in any state’s WQSs. Depending on the scientific views or other issues raised during
the comment period, the draft updated criteria recommendations may change.87 Accordingly,
EPA has not made an “unequivocal determination” prior to the issuance of these seven permits
that the existing benzene and benzo(a)pyrene criteria do not provide the requisite protection.88
Furthermore, future actions are required by Massachusetts before effluent limits may be based on
the draft updated water quality criteria for benzene and benzo(a)pyrene. The draft criteria, even
when finalized, will not constitute regulations or new WQSs and are not automatically
incorporated into a state’s WQSs. Rather, “EPA’s recommended water quality criteria provide
technical information for States…to establish water quality standards under the Clean Water Act
to protect human health.”89 In other words, the EPA recommended criteria, which were
developed under certain assumptions at a national level, only have a regulatory impact once they
have been adopted into WQSs by Massachusetts. Although EPA’s recommended criteria are
generally adopted, states have the discretion to adopt them, modify them to reflect site-specific
conditions, or adopt different criteria based on other scientifically-defensible methods.90 Thus,
states ultimately conclude, based on state-specific factors, what criteria are protective of human
health and will be applicable in their WQSs. Consequently, the state has yet to issue any
conclusion, tentative or otherwise, regarding the protectiveness of the current criteria in
Massachusetts waters.91 To conclude at this point that a different concentration might not
ultimately be selected in Massachusetts for site-specific reasons is premature. Thus, the Region
believes that the Administrator’s issuance of these draft updated recommended criteria does not
invalidate the Region’s conclusions in the EJA regarding the effects of the re-issuance of the
permits on minority or low-income populations.

Comment I1:
Good evening. My name is Staci Rubin. I am the senior attorney and director of the
Environmental Justice Legal Services Program at ACE, Alternatives for Community and
Environment. ACE is providing legal services to residents in Revere, Chelsea and East Boston
regarding the Draft NPDES Permits for the seven facilities that are the subject of tonight's public
hearing. My comments tonight are on behalf of ACE. And we, along with the residents of
Chelsea, East Boston and Revere will submit detailed written comments by May 12th.
Thank you to both EPA and DEP for holding tonight's hearing at a convenient location and
providing translated documents in advance, as well as the interpretation for tonight's public
hearing. I appreciate that EPA took the time to meet with ACE and members of the Chelsea
Creek Action Group on three occasions in 2013, and held a community meeting last June about
the NPDES process.
There is an anti-backsliding requirement for NPDES permits, which means that the requirements
of a subsequent or newly issued permit may not be less stringent than previous permits. As has
been said, the Chelsea Creek water quality continues to disappoint. The Commonwealth has
classified the Chelsea Creek as a Class SB water body, meaning that its water quality should be
able to support wading, swimming, fishing, boating and a health fish and aquatic life community.
Yet, the water has not achieved this standard. No matter how far away this standard appears, the
water quality should improve notwithstanding sanitary sewer overflows, combined sewer
overflows and marine vessel pollution.
My remaining comments concern all seven permits. First, my comments concerning the permits
from a technical perspective. The Chelsea River is listed as a Category 5 waters, which requires a
total maximum daily load on the final Massachusetts year 2012 Integrated List of Waters under
the Clean Water Act. This is both Sections 303(d) and 305(b). The pollutants and conditions
requiring a total maximum daily load are ammonia, fecal coliform, dissolved oxygen,
polychlorinated biphenyls in fish, petroleum hydrocarbons and others. The designated uses for
the Chelsea River are impaired. Sources of those impairments include the petroleum facilities at
issue tonight. EPA and DEP state that the Draft Permit sufficient limit petroleum hydrocarbons
and total suspended solids to ensure that discharges do not cause or contribute to the aquatic life
impairment. EPA and DEP cannot make this statement because there is no total maximum daily
load limits that have been set for the Chelsea River. These permits, all seven, should not be
issued prior to establishment of the total maximum daily load limits. The state of Rhode Island
recently established these limits for a portion of the Blackstone River. And that's a river that has
endured heavy industrial use similar to the Chelsea Creek. The Commonwealth and EPA could
incorporate this effort as a model. Further, the Mystic River Watershed Association has recorded
data for the Chelsea Creek which could help establish a baseline for these numbers.
Should EPA and DEP disagree and decide to issue these final permits without first approving
total maximum daily loads, then I respectfully request additional conditions for these permits.
The pollutant scans for each facility outfall should be required quarterly, not annually. Including
for ethanol, for facilities that store or manage ethanol. And the permittees should be required to
conduct the pollutant scan, effluent testing at regular quarterly intervals. The permittees should
117

be required to conduct the whole effluent toxicity testing quarterly, not annually. And the
permittee should be required to report immediately when they exceed the total flow rate and the
maximum daily flow rate. Furthermore, both EPA and DEP should conduct more frequent and
unannounced inspections of all seven facilities, and issue fines when the facilities are out of
compliance. All seven of the terminals have been out of compliance at least one quarter during
the past five years. And to my knowledge, EPA or DEP did not take any enforcement action. The
EPA should also establish a website specifically dedicated to the Chelsea Creek that includes
updated information about current and past water quality tests and violation information.
In addition to the reasons I just discussed, the Draft Permits are inadequate because of their
failure to consider climate change impacts. Section 316(a) of the Clean Water Act requires EPA
to consider the change to the ambient water temperature in the Chelsea Creek because of an
effluent discharge. Several of these facilities have boiler blow down from steam boilers, which
would release more and more hot water into the creek. And that warming of the water needs to
be considered in the climate change context. As water temperatures increase, water pollution
problems will increase. As temperature increases, dissolved oxygen levels will be creating more
complex environmental conditions which don't seem to be taken into consideration with these
Draft Permits. Further, these permits are jointly issued by EPA and DEP as was said. And under
General Laws of Massachusetts, Chapter 30, Section 61, in paragraph 2, DEP needs to make
findings about reasonably foreseeable climate change impacts, which have not been done in the
Draft Permits.
My next comments concern the Environmental Justice Assessment. While this particular
Environmental Justice analysis is the most robust that I have seen out of Region 1, I think, more
analyses are required. EPA recently developed a tool, CFERST, the Community Focused
Exposure and Risk Screening Tool. That should be consulted to identify additional health
information, such as cancer rates, particularly for cancers that are known to be associated with
benzene exposure. There should be some analysis of whether health indicators in the study area
and the larger host cities demonstrate health inequities, whether there are -- the health of one
racial or ethnic group is different than other racial or ethnic groups, and how those compare to
the statewide average. And there should also be an analysis of water exposure and how contact
with the contaminated water could affect human health.
Further, EPA concludes in its assessment that, because the effluent limits in the Draft Permits
will ensure that the facilities do not contribute to water violations, this permitting action with
therefore not disproportionately affect human health or the environment. This seems to be quite
conclusory and it doesn't discuss how the effluent limits will improve water quality or remedy
the past injustice of the environmental contamination. EPA should consider whether to require
that signs be placed at the various access points to the creek. There are a few. But, whether those
should be placed, and discuss the water impairments to the creek. Those signs should be
available in multiple languages.
In conclusion, the communities that abut the facilities on the Chelsea Creek face not only an
Environmental Justice burden, but a pollution burden of historical proportions. These permits
must acknowledge this reality and incorporate the suggested changes so that conditions in the

118

Chelsea Creek improve and contribute to environmental justice in Chelsea, East Boston and
Revere.
Response to Comment I1:
See Response to Comment C6, as the comments are substantially identical. See also Responses
to Comments C1 and C5 in Part I.
Comments submitted by Roseann Bongiovanni, Associate Executive Director, Chelsea
Collaborative:
Comment J1:
Good evening. My name is Roseann Bongiovanni. I'm a Chelsea resident and I'm also the
Assistant Director of the Chelsea Collaborative, which represents the Chelsea side of the Chelsea
Creek Action Group. Thank you to the EPA and the DEP for being here this evening in Chelsea,
and for making this presentation and for providing interpretation services for our community.
I also would like to thank the EPA for conducting an Environmental Justice analysis in
correlation to these NPDES permits. In going through the EJ analysis, I had a comment that
stood out to me. I was looking at the compliance and inspection history. Global Petroleum
terminal had four violations. And yet, there are only two federal Clean Water Act inspections.
Global REVCO terminal had three violations. And yet, there are only two Clean Water Act
inspections from the federal government. Irving had five violations. And there are only three
federal inspections. Similarly, Chelsea Sandwich had two violations and only two inspections.
And four violations for the Gulf Oil terminal and only one inspection. And all of these
inspections happened over a five year time frame. So, in the course of five years, each of these
facilities, the maximum time that they got inspected was four. So, less than once per year. And
that was for Sunoco that actually had no violations. It's startling to me how few inspections from
the EPA there are on these facilities. There are seven facilities. As you've heard from so many
members of this body and others, these communities surrounding the facilities are Environmental
Justice communities. And we need more regular inspections of these facilities. We're relying on
the industries to tell us when they're in violation of their own permits. So, we're essentially
trusting the word of the companies, and yet, not doing any enforcement, taking any enforcement
actions, or following up with any inspections. I implore you, in these NPDES permits, to require
more frequent inspections by the EPA, at a very minimum of twice per year of each of these
terminal facilities. And I would encourage you to do those inspections on an unannounced visit
rather than letting them know well in advance so that they can prepare adequately.
Further, I've learned from other communities in the nearby area that, when there have been
violations of federal or state permits, the community has advocated that those companies in
violation of their permits pay for consultants so that community groups, like the Chelsea Creek
Action Group, could be better informed of what those violations mean and how those results are
interpreted to the community. So, I would implore you to include those on these NPDES permits.
That any time one of these industries is in violation of their permit that they either, one, pay

119

towards a community enhancement or improvement project. Or two, that they provide for a
consultant to translate these results to the community at large.
Similar to City Council President Frank, I want to encourage you to look at these permits, and as
Madeline said as well, in a cumulative effect. You know, as we've heard, we're looking at each
one of these permits in a silo, as if only -- as if there was only one terminal along the creek.
There are seven terminals, seven terminals discharging pollutants all the time into the Chelsea
Creek. And the only way that we can improve the Chelsea Creek is to have these permits be
more and more stringent. The last time we issued these permits was in 2005. While there have
been some changes and improvements made on these permits that you have shown as the Draft,
we still feel like they're not stringent enough. They need to be far more stringent. We've gone
almost 10 years. A lot has happened in 10 years. And these permits should reflect that. In 10
years’ time, we want to be here saying that the Chelsea Creek is far cleaner than it was in 2014.
And with the permits the way they are right now, we don't see that happening. The Chelsea
Creek Action Group with the Mystic River Watershed Association and other organizations have
been working very, very hard to improve the water quality of the Chelsea Creek, to reduce
stormwater runoff, to reduce pollutants, to work with companies to be more accountable. And
the only way we can deal with this holistically is if the EPA and DEP were to come down harder
on these industries that are lining our waterfront.
Again, I want to thank you for coming here this evening. And I hope that, as you go back and
review this data that, again, you think about Environmental Justice and this being an
Environmental Justice -- all of these communities that are on the creek, being Environmental
Justice communities, and that you take this opportunity as a significant step forward to say that
Environmental Justice is important and that we want to do the right thing to make these permits
even more stringent.
Thank you.

Deletion: The reference to reporting sample results below the minimum level for the
parameters included in footnote 8 and 9 in Part I.A.1. has been removed, as requirements

Sunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals L.P.

NPDES Permit #MA0004006

for reporting results below the practical quantitation limit are already specified in
footnote 3.
Addition: The Measurement Frequency and Sample Type for Part I.A.2. Sum of Group I
PAHs was inadvertently omitted. These have been specified as monthly, and grab,
respectively.
Change: The permit condition in Part I.A.11. has been revised to state: “The Permittee
shall not discharge any toxic pollutant or material including, but not limited to…”
(emphasis added to the change). The provision in Part I.A.17.c. contains the phrase
regarding “use or manufacture”, which was deleted from Part I.A.11.
Change: The permit condition in Part I.A.16.b. for sampling of hydrostatic test water has
been modified to require a minimum of three effluent samples at a specified point in the
duration of the discharge. The influent sample requirement has been modified to remove
requirements where municipal water supply is used as the fill source. The permit
condition in Part I.A.16.c. clarifies that influent samples, when required, are to be
analyzed for the parameters indicated. Total recoverable chromium has been added to the
list of parameters required.
4. Part I.B.
Addition: The title for Part I.B. has been modified to note that additional allowable
discharges as well as unauthorized discharges are contained within this part.
Change: The prohibition of the discharge of additives, including, but not limited to:
glutaraldehyde, ethylene glycol, butoxyethanol, alkylacrelate nitrito styrene polymer,
coco alkylamine, 1,2,3 and 4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and methyl
isobutyl ketone, has been moved from Part I.A.16. to Part I.B.3.c.
5. Part I.C.
Change: The title for Part I.C. has been changed to Non-numeric Technology-based
Effluent Limitations and Additional Requirements. All provisions formerly included in

the remainder of the control measure requirements.
Addition: The control measures included in Part I.C.1.b-f. in the draft permit and by
reference are now included in Part I.C.2. of the final permit. Control measure
requirements included in the draft permit have been retained with limited typographical
adjustment.
Change: The phrase “permittee shall implement” has replaced “SWPPP must include” for
the discharge practices best management practice, the spill control best management
practice, and the stormwater system best management practice included in the draft

Sunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals L.P.

NPDES Permit #MA0004006

permit in Part I.C.1.d-f. to align with the content changes to Part I.C. and Part I.D. These
best management practices are included in the final permit at Part I.C.3-5.
Addition: The discharge practices best management practice includes additional
terminology consistent with the definition of a qualifying event added to footnote 1 in
Part I.A.1. and voluntary sample coordination with other bulk petroleum storage facilities
that discharge to the Chelsea River.
Change: The inspection requirements included under SWPPP requirements in Part
I.C.1.g. of the draft permit have been moved to Part I.C.6. in the final permits with
limited typographical adjustment which states, “the Permittee shall conduct facility
inspections”.

Updated EJ Analysis Sections IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC Incorporating a
1.0 Mile Buffer Around Chelsea River
IIIA. Social Demographics
EPA compiled demographic indicators pertinent to two different buffers around the Chelsea
River as well as comparable indicators obtained for the entire state of Massachusetts using
EPA’s EJView database and the U.S. Census’ American Community Survey 2006-2010.

State: US Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2006-2010.
http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml (Tables DP05, B19301, and
DP02).
Overall the percent of the population residing within the 0.5 mile buffer around the Chelsea
River that identifies itself as Hispanic in origin is about six-fold greater than that reported for the
state as a whole and more than half of the individuals residing in the 0.5 mile buffer around the
Chelsea River report speaking a language other than English in the home. In comparing
demographic indicators for populations residing within in a one mile buffer around the Chelsea
River, the percent of the population that identifies itself as Hispanic in origin is about five-fold
greater than that reported for the state as a whole and about two-fifths of the individuals residing
in the 1 mile buffer around Chelsea River report speaking a language other than English in the
home. The per capita income reported for residents in either of the two buffer areas is about two
thirds of the per capita income reported for all Massachusetts residents.

IIIB. Environment
EPA compiled readily available data on surface water quality and sites or facilities located in the
two buffer areas around Chelsea River and in Chelsea, Revere, East Boston, Everett and
Charlestown.
1. Surface Water Quality
Each facility operates one outfall that discharges into Chelsea River. One facility, Global
REVCO, also discharges treated effluent into Sales Creek. Chelsea River is an urban tidal river
flowing from the mouth of Mill Creek, between Chelsea and Revere, to Boston’s Inner Harbor,
between East Boston and Chelsea. For centuries Chelsea River has been flanked by working
industries which have used the channel to transport raw materials and finished goods. Sales
Creek is a small water body which flows into Belle Isle Inlet and into Winthrop Bay.
The Chelsea River is one of eleven Designated Port Areas (DPAs) established by the
Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management to promote and protect water-dependent
industrial uses.1 In general, the designation places some limitations on public access to and
recreational use of a waterfront area.2
As discussed in the permit Fact Sheets, MassDEP’s federally-approved water quality standards
classify the segment of the Chelsea River in which the facilities are located as Class SB (CSO). 3
Class SB waters are described in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Surface Water Quality
Standards (WQSs) (314 CMR 4.05(4)(b)) as follows: “These waters are designated as a habitat
for fish, other aquatic life and wildlife, including for their reproduction, migration, growth and
other critical functions, and for primary and secondary contact recreation. In certain waters,
habitat for fish, other aquatic life and wildlife may include, but is not limited to, seagrass…These
waters shall have consistently good aesthetic value.” Sales Creek is classified as SA (ORW).
The Chelsea River and Sales Creek are part of the Boston Harbor Drainage Area.
EPA Region 1 has been issuing the Mystic River Watershed a water quality Report Card based
on bacterial contamination since 2006. The report card is a collaborative effort between EPA and
the Mystic River Watershed Association and informs the public about water quality issues as
well as identifies watershed areas of concern. Historically, the report card grades have fluctuated
between a D- and C-. The watershed received a D for water quality in 2012.4
2. Particular Facilities or Sites
EPA has identified facilities or sites located within the 0.5 mile study area bordering Chelsea
River located in the cities of Chelsea, Revere, and East Boston that are required to report to, or
that are otherwise listed or tracked by EPA and/or MassDEP. These sites are depicted in

Figure 15 from the EJ Analysis of March 2014 and in the table that follows and supporting
Attachments B and C to the EJ Analysis of March 2014. In response to comments, EPA also
identified sites located within a 1.0 mile buffer bordering Chelsea River and has depicted these
facilities in Figure 1A of Appendix 1 and in the table that follows. In expanding the study area
to one mile, areas in Everett and Charlestown were added to the buffer area and thus the number
of regulated facilities in Everett and Charlestown were added for comparison purposes. The
criteria that the agencies use in determining which sites or facilities to track varies depending on
the particular type of site or facility involved. The fact that sites and facilities are tracked by the
agencies does not necessarily reflect any conclusion regarding the extent to which particular sites
or facilities present a health or environmental hazard to the surrounding community.

IIIC. Health
EPA compiled health indicators obtained from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health
(MA DPH) Community Health Information Profiles (CHIPS) and the MA DPH Environmental
Public Health Tracking Network database. These databases contain health information for
Boston, Revere, Chelsea, and Everett as well as for the state of Massachusetts and were chosen
because the scale of health data resolution (e.g., town vs. county level) is finer than that afforded
by other databases such as EJView. Unfortunately, health statistics were not of fine enough
resolution to enable health characterizations specific to the study area. In presenting this health

or sites are regulated under multiple programs.

specifically or directly linked to the existence of any particular pollution source in or affecting
the area, or of pollution in general.
